* except at parades, liquor stores**, and Great Aunt Joan's***
** Did you know this? Most liquor stores have lollipops behind the counter, you just have to ask. Say it's for your kid. They won't know, I've tested it. True story.
*** Except Great Aunt Joan only has those dusty tasting Brach's chocolate stars, and seriously how long have they been in that dish? Plus I don't trust her dachshund Helmut. Has he licked them already? That dog is NASTY.
