The results are in and the candy, specifically a Take 5 bar, goes to Chris Gayler. Congrats to Chris for his daring selection of Kentucky. I understand there are parties in the streets of Santa Barbara celebrating Gayler's victory, or wherever it is Chris resides these days.

Another Chris, Christopher LeVasseur, comes in 2nd place and wins the traditional 2nd place prize of BIG FAT NOTHING.

The 3rd place prize is a CD my choosing. We have a tie in 3rd place between Doug Eakins and...Doug Eakins. You see, this is the problem with entering your clone in a candy bar pool, they think just like you. In reality, Doug probably hit the "Go Ben Go" button to submit his picks once, didn't understand the weird rolling credits after submitting, hit back and then submitted again. On second thought, that's ridiculous. Must have been his clone.

In the spirit of this 100% totally free candy bar pool, I am going to close this year by asking you for money. I'm riding 150 miles on my bike in June to raise money for Multiple Sclerosis research. I rode last year and found that I was so poor at fundraising that I had to donate most of the minimum goal out of my own pocket. That would have been totally fine, except I was totally out-fundraised by my friend Larry, and this I cannot stand for again. SO, if you have read this far*, and feel like helping my cause of BEATING LARRY, pass the MS Society some money in my name:

* I am officially in clear violation of fundraising rule #1: Get to the point.

Final Standings
