My analysis of the championship game, in haiku
	Terrific contest
	thrilling and competitive
	referees awful

JQMCBP XVI has come to a close, and I'd like to congratulate William Hershey of Michigan who picked Louisville in the final. Once more for effect: William Hershey of *MICHIGAN*, who picked *LOUISVILLE* in the final. Was that worth a King Size Snickers, William? Eat it slowly, savoring each delicious bite of chocolate, peanuts, and nougat* as you are given the stink eye from all those around you.

In second place by one razor thin point was Josh Nisenson, and for his efforts he wins the traditional 2nd place award of BIG FAT NOTHING. Josh has let me know he won his office pool, which amounted to a cash award worth about 300 candy bars. Nothing cools the sting of a JQMCBP loss more than cold hard cash.

Third place winners of A Crappy CD of My Choosing are Jared Elfvin of Illinois and Bruce Ghastin of Michigan. Before departing Arizona my pal Lance handed me CDs of Girlz Rock and The Backyardigans, but I forgot to bring them home. So, instead you will be getting something else of similar or worse quality.

I hope you all had grand fun of me making fun of so many of you**, I know I did. Barring a fatal zeppelin crash I'll be back again next year, hopefully with some new and pointless analysis tools. I know you're not going to believe this, but I've got some crazy ideas.

A quick request, unrelated to the pool. I'm riding 150 miles on my bicycle in June to help fund MS research. If you would like to help me in that fundraising effort (as a few of you already have), here's the link

Nice run for your school, mellissa simko. I'm sure you are waking up in the middle of the night wondering JUST HOW YOU CAN CALL A JUMP BALL THAT FAST, but nevertheless a solid showing for the Shockers. As Keenan Thompson playing Charles Barkley would say, "I wasn't even aware WichEEta was a state!"

Also nice to the late great Fielding Yost coming back from the afterlife again to try to win some candy.
