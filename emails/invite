Greetings intrepid candy seekers! Just one week until the JQMCBP XVII opens for entries!

Has it been a year already? Are you feeling lucky? Are your spam filters loose enough to let my email in?

I can only answer the first question, which is a resounding yes. The time has almost arrived for the 17th Johnny Quest Memorial Candy Bar Pool! Get your prognosticating skills and/or best coin for flipping ready. Selection Sunday is March 16th, and the exclusive (by which I mean not exclusive at all) JQMCBP invites will follow forthwith. Posthaste. Straightaway. Pronto.

If you enjoyed last year's epic struggle for sugared refreshment, please let all of your family, friends, acquaintances, enemies, frenemies, and paid consultants know about this exciting competition and with your help we'll make it the biggest ever. Without your help I just might be forced to increase the size of the chimp army to artificially set my enrollment goals. You know, in the computer world you can increase an army by just a push of the button (i.e., adding a 0 to the end of 1000 in my EVIL chimp creation program).

I'd tell you all about the exciting enhancments for this year's JQMCBP, but that would be giving away trade secrets. Also I haven't thought of anything yet.

cheers,
The Meister
