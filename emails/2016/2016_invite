Are you feeling lucky? Well are ya? 

Please let literally everyone you know about this exciting competition. First grade teacher? Probably wants to know about it. Person that sat next to you on an airplane and described, at length, how mind control was the most serious issue of the 21st Century? They will want to play. Old neighbor that burned your fence down? Okay, not that guy. Seriously, who burns down a fence?
