Aaaaaaaand we're back!

I'm excited to proclaim JQMCBP XV live and ready for another year of inane pleasure. I've given you all a few years to think about what life is like without JQMCBP, and I think we can all agree it's a tough, tough slog without it. The wait is over.

Please tell anyone you want about JQMCBP, including people you _think_ already know about its triumphant return. Every year it gets harder for me to successfully email people via my home-brewed emailer program, which (*gasp*) spam filters often flag as spam. The indignity. My email to 2009's 658 participants resulted in about 50 bounced emails (typically people that had changed email addresses), and I have no idea how many just got filtered out.

You can even tell your friends to tell their friends. Heck, even sworn enemies are welcome. Wouldn't it be cool to outnumber the chimp army for once?

Candy!
