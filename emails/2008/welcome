Welcome to JQMCBP XII! The games are now underway, and the pool has closed with the 12th consecutive record number of entries. 681 humans (+1001 chimps) are gunning for the candy this year, and I have a graph to prove it:

This is just a brief email to give you the link to your bracket. Full email irreverance/irrelevance will begin after the games complete tonight.

Not all of the links below work just yet (e.g., graphomatic), but they should be fired up and ready to go later tonight.

cheers-
The Meister
