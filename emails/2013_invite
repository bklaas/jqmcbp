The Johnny Quest Memorial Candy Bar Pool Committee is pleased to announce its very exclusive invitations for participation in JQMCBP XVI. To maintain the exclusivity of this pool, please forward this to absolutely anyone. It's likely the Spam Police will have filtered this email from many of you, so if you know someone that you assume would be getting this, instead assume they did not and let them know to enter.

Get your picks and candy selection entered before the games begin on the morning of Thursday, March 21..
