(queue cinematic soundtrack as sun rises over a futuristic dystopian landscape)
In a World...where everything seems crazy...

(shadows of a thousand chimpanzees marching lock step)
...where a nation is led by a shameless primate...

(from out of the fog emerges The Candymeister, armed with nothing but voluminous emails and a penchant for handing out candy to strangers)
...One Man rises up to free the shackles of a tortured people...

(DROP THE BASS)
