<p>To introduce newcomers to the JQMCBP, Lucky the Chimp is our loyal mascot and favorite repeat offender (see below). He's back again with his random coin-flip-generated picks for the contest, and he's again brought his <a href = "?army">POSSE.</a></p>

<p>Lucky had a dream run in 2001, picking Duke to win it all (which they did). Although his other picks didn't do so well, he still beat a huge number of entrants.</p>

<p>This year Lucky has assembled his <a href = "?army">1000 CHIMP ARMY</a> again in an effort exact justice for his years of futile efforts.</p>
