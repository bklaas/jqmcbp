<p>
The Candymeister welcomes you all to yet another Quest for Candy!
</p>

<p>
For the rookies:
What I do is send out email updates (personalized just for your entry!) several times during the course of the tournament. I go on and on and on over seemingly meaningless minutia. It might seem meaningless but...well okay, it's meaningless. But we'll have fun, or your money back.*
</p>

<p>
In addition to the emails, there's lots of important, vital resources available with your web browser. Evaluate how risky your picks are with the J Factor, see who picked brackets like yours with the Scientific Similarity Index. As the tournament progresses, figure out who has no chance of winning at the Hall of Shame! Generate pointless head-to-head graphs! Check out the linky links at the bottom of the email or head to <a href = "http://benklaas.com/jqmcbp/leaderboard.cgi">The Leaderboard</a> as a jumping off point.
</p>

<p>
As I've done for the past few years, I'm sending emails through the appropriately named <a href = "http://mailchimp.com">MailChimp</a> mass email service. This is Lucky the Chimp's favorite email service, and because it actually sends emails that people tend to receive. However, MailChimp will not allow me to send multiple emails to the same email address. So, if you signed up several brackets on one email address, you only be getting one personalized email for each entry. How about we call this a "feature" and call an end to the tech talk.
</p>

<p>
* Refund applications need to be filed in triplicate and mailed to the Johnny Quest Memorial Candy Bar Pool Customer Service Department, care of its Parent Corporation, Slaptronics Personal Massage Therapy and Self Help Video Distribution Corporation of Netherland Antilles (nasdaq:SPMTSHVDCNA). Or you could contact your congressperson, which will give you a similar outcome.
</p>

<p>
Now let's get on with it!
</p>

<hr class = 'section' />
<h1>Whahappened?</h1>

<p>
WOW, did the brackets blow up early today. In case you didn't know, there is just a wee bit of bias for Iowa State in this pool, and that's even if head coach Fred Hoiberg did <a href="http://benklaas.com/jqmcbp/emails/2014/shattereddreams.html">end my basketball career</a>. Well, ISU-heavy brackets are straight out the window after a surprising upset at the hands of the Alabama-Birmingham "Blazers", which I was shocked to learn is not referring to a lightweight, often striped or brightly colored sports jacket having pockets and notched lapels. Nope, the UAB Blazer is some kind of fire-breathing dragon type thing. I wish someone would have told ISU, maybe they would have taken them more seriously. While researching this topic I also discovered that UAB's first- and second-round games are being played at, I am not making this up, the KFC Yum! Center. Putting aside the oxymoronic nature of that name, this got me wondering if the Center is situated near the Taco Bell Guacamolito! Center for the Performing Arts, and if so, are there plans to <a href = "https://youtu.be/EQ8ViYIeH04">combine the two as they sometimes do with Pizza Hut</a>?
</p>

<p>
Then Georgia State knocked off another #3 seed, Baylor. All in all, not a good start for...anyone that thinks they know anything about basketball.

<h1>Reflections On the Nature of Pool Selections, in Two Parts</h1>
<p>
My daughter Piper, entered in this pool as "Piper Klaas AWESOMENESS" was excited to enter her picks for a chance to win her choice, Popin' Cookin' Happy Sushi House. Yes, <a href = "https://popincookin.com/shop/popin-cookin-sushi/">this is a thing</a>. I was excited to hear the one-sided banter as she navigated the bracket selection:
</p>
Piper: 
<div class = 'quote'>
Ookla or Smew? I think Ookla
</div>
The Meister: 
<div class = 'quote'>
Piper, that's UCL...
</div>
Piper: 
<div class = 'quote'>
Where is Wah-Cheetah State? There aren't any states called Wah-Cheetah.
</div>
The Meister: 
<div class = 'quote'>
It's pronounced Wichi...
</div>
Piper: 
<div class = 'quote'>
I'm going with Wah-Cheetah.
</div>
The Meister: 
<div class = 'quote'>

</div>
Piper: 
<div class = 'quote'>
What's a Purdue? Doesn't matter, Chin Chitty's better

I'm taking Chin Chitty all the way!
</div>

<p>
Don't believe me? <a href ="http://benklaas.com/jqmcbp/player_bracket.cgi?player_id=12351">Chin Chitty All the Way</a>
</p>

<p>
Now the second act. My lovely wife, Wendy "Take 5" Volkman, agonizes over these picks every year. Never mind the fact she is the JQMCBP V champion, she's convinced that there's some method to this madness, as well as thinking I have some innate ability to help her with that method. Anyway, these are highlights of the "live blogging" of her bracket selections.
</p>

Wendy:

Who's going to win between Duke and Robert Morris? Is Robert Morris just one guy?

Wendy:

What is Stephen F Austin? Isn't that the three million man?
</div>

The Meister:
<div class = 'quote'>
The three million dollar man? It's six million!
</div>

Wendy:

Well, he's no Steve Austin. Wait, is that his name?
</div>

Wendy:

Well, there's Stone Cold Steve Austin.

<div class = 'quote'>
Well. That changes everything.

Wendy:

<h1>Shout Outs</h1>
<h2>where I pseudo-randomly (by which I mean not randomly at all) give a shout out to one or many of you, my loyal pool contestants.</h2>

<p>
Father-in-law Glen "Giant Snickers Bar" Volkman made sure to get his picks in on Monday night because Tuesday he had multiple bypass surgery. Good to see you had your priorities in line, Glen, and a big shout out from all of JQMCBP. Even the chimps.
</p>

<p>
And to the wee Cormac "Jumbo Box of Nerds" O'Boyle, who had this to say about entering my NCAA pool:

<h1>Mailbag</h1>

<p>
Now a tradition, Lawrence Wolski shared with me the team-by-team, or rather mascot-by-mascot analysis of every first round matchup by fellow pool participant Blair "Goldenberg's Peanut Chews" Brownyard. It's a very long list. A couple highlights:
</p>

<div class = 'quote'>
Maryland v. Valparaiso: Terrapin v. Crusader = Terrapins really aren't that tough. But then you have a dude in a suit of metal. But you know what's missing? A [expletive deleted] SWORD. He's all D and no O. Terrapin wins because in a fight of defense, that's what terrapins are good at.
</div>

<div class = 'quote'>
Michigan State v. Georgia - Wolverine v. another [expletive deleted] bulldog = whoever said bulldogs were tough just hasn't spent enough time with them. They're short, slow, have terrible hygiene, and slobber over everything. They just suck. And wolverines are all that's good in the world - wolverines win almost everytime.
</div>

<p>
Blair has really passionate opinions on this*, so I don't feel comfortable telling him that the mascot of Michigan State is not a wolverine.
</p>

<p>
* I'd share more, but so much cursing!
</p>


<p>Note: Blair has <a href = "http://benklaas.com/jqmcbp/player_bracket.cgi?player_id=12339">UAB to *win it all*</a>. It ain't over yet, Blair!</p>
