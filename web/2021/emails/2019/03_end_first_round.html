The first round has come to a close and we've got a 6-way tie at the top (see bottom of email). 1-seeds Virginia, North Carolina, and Duke all looked sketchy in the first halves of their games, but they all took care of bidness in the end. It's a pity, because destroying "expert" brackets is one of the True Joys of being the Candymeister. In that vein, may this weekend show the Terriers of Wofford, the Anteaters of UC-Irvine, the (okay, need to look this one up) Knights of Central Florida, and the Racers of Murray State continued success.

<h1>Losing Mascots: Let's Talk About Them!</h1>
<h2>Pointless Discussion about Losing Teams and Their Mascots</h2>

<p>
I mean, I could deep dive the <a href = "https://www.slu.edu/about/key-facts/what-is-a-billiken.php">Billikens</a>, but instead I think I'll give you an anecdote about Cyclones. But not the Iowa State Cyclones, instead their dimunitive counterpart the Ames High "Little Cyclones"*
</p>

<p>
The actual mascot of Iowa State is a Cardinal (which is not an ornithologically accurate depiction of a cardinal, but that's a story for another day), because its colors are Cardinal and Gold. Ames High's colors, and this is important to the story, are Black and Orange.</p>

<p>So back in the 1980s, in the long long ago, AHS decided it needed to have its own dressed up mascot for games. Rather than a Cardinal, which didn't make sense, even if depicted with ornithological accuracy, they went with a cyclone. Since you can't go with black, as this wouldn't be easily seen at a night football game, they went with orange. If you think about the physical structure of a cyclone, it's pretty narrow at the top and pretty wide at the bottom. If you're in that costume, as 1989 AHS graduate Robert Wilke was, your options are effectively limited to one option: spinning around.
</p>
<p>
So basically, we'd come to games and watch Robert try not to get to dizzy/sick as the World's Only Twirling Carrot.
</p>

<p>* My junior high school (best one in Ames until they closed it down) was the Whirlwinds, a perfectly excellent on-topic mascot. Ames High could have chosen the Tornadoes, the Dirt Devils, the Twisters, or even the Dangerous Straight Line Winds. But nope, they went with "Little Cyclones". Like a tornado, only not so scary!</p>

<p>
Side note on the last email's discussion of how Vermont should have gone with a Camel as a mascot. I've since learned that not only do the Connecticut College teams call themselves the Camels, but 2018 graduate and two-time NCAA DIII Water Polo Champion* Sophia Soriano** is a proud JQMCBP entrant.
</p>

<p>
* The Connecticut College women's water polo team calls themselves the CoCoWoWaPo Camels, which is undisputably freaking awesome.

<h1>Upsets...who picked 'em</h1>
<h2>Highlighting those brave souls that chose oddball longshots to win games</h2>

<p>
As is typical of the second day of the first round, the upsets showed up. The big ones were UC-Irvine (go <a href = "https://tenor.com/view/anteater-kangaroo-come-at-me-bro-hop-away-scared-gif-3531605">Anteaters!</a>) over Kansas State, <a href = "https://deadspin.com/as-i-lay-me-down-to-sleep-i-pray-for-liberty-to-freaki-1833513734">Liberty</a> over Mississippi State, and...as will be endlessly discussed below, Ohio State over Iowa State. There were close to 150 each that picked these upsets, so I won't list them here, but I will instead talk about the fully predictable Irrational Confidence of Iowa State fans.
</p>

<p>
This is an actual group text exchange made last week after Iowa State won the Big 12 conference tournament:
</p>

<div class = 'mailbag'>
Matt Smalling*: What seed do you think the Cyclones will end up?

Joshua Littrell**: #5!

The Meister***: Have watched a fair bit of isu hoops this year. When they are good they are very very good. But when they aren't...not so much. I expect a lot of irrational confidence after last night from the legions of clones fans in the pool. I'd guess 6 seed, maybe a 5.

Jason Teal****: They are going to win it all!

<a href = "https://giphy.com/search/facepalm">&lt;facepalm.gif&gt;</a>
</div>

<p>* 80th place. Predicted Iowa State in the Final 8</p>
<p>** Could not be bothered entering JQMCBP. Known to play air guitar in front of children.</p>
<p>*** 30th place. Predicted Iowa State to Sweet 16</p>
<p>**** 447th place. Predicted Iowa State in the Final 8</p>

<h1>Boo Rah Rah</h1>
<h2>I asked you if your alma mater was in the tournament. Why? So I could make fun of you when they lose!</h2>

<p>
I have degrees from both Wisconsin and Iowa State, and always consider which to put on as my alma mater (A: Badgers), but this year it would not have mattered, as both saw themselves out Friday. 79 people consoled themselves by muttering to themselves that their school's athletic prowess in no way had anything to do with all the other bad choices they'd made*.

<p>In case you haven't seen it on the website already, I'm riding 150 miles to support the MS society. The JQMCBP is always and forever 100% free, but if you're so inclined <a href = "http://bit.ly/bkMS150_2019">you may donate buckets of cash to my ride here</a>.

<h2>Top 10 Humans</h2>

<p>
Deanne "Snickers" Busta led alone for much of Friday night but was finally caught by 6 others: Curtis John "Skittles" Mitchell, Dan "king size Rollo[sic]" Reed, Joaquin "Kit Kat", Kyra "Sour Patch Kids" Whitelaw, and awesome bar triva runner/co-worker Kari "Butterfinger" Williams. Chris "Milk Chocolate Flavored Yoo Hoo Candy Bar" Larson, through an unexpected quirk of random normal statistical distributions, sits alone in 7th place.
