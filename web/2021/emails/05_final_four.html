<h1>WHO'S STILL IN IT?</h1>

<p>
As we head into the Final Four this weekend, I know the question burning in all of your minds is this: IS THE CANDY STILL IN MY GRASP?
</p>
<p>After running the numbers, I am 99.16% sure when I tell you the answer is NOPE. For 0.84% of you, there is HOPE.
</p>
<p>Rob Strnad has told me that it's always appropriate to use this.</p>

<p>Here's the rundown:</p>

<ul>
<li>If Baylor wins the championship, <b>Mark Dyal</b> wins a <b>Milky Way.</b></li>
<li>If Gonzaga wins over Houston in the Final, <b>Dawn Smith</b> wins a <b>Strawberry Charleston Chew</b></li>
<li>If Gonzaga wins over Baylor in the Final, <b>Terese Bryan</b> wins a <b>Dark Chocolate Reese's</b></li>
<li>If Houston wins over Gonzaga in the Final, <b>Tracy "T-bone" Reese's PB Cup</b> wins a <strike>T-bone</strike> <b>Reese's PB Cup (singular)</b>.</li>
<li>If Houston wins over UCLA in the Final, <b>Tracy "T-bone" Reese's PB Cup</b> TIES with <b>Thomas Leeper</b>, who wins a <b>Super Milk Bundle</b></li>
<li>If UCLA wins over Baylor in the Final, <b>Richard Doher</b> wins <b>Mike and Ike's</b></li>
<li>If UCLA wins over Houston in the Final, <b>Richard Doher</b> TIES with...wait for it...<b>CARLEE THE CHIMP!</b> That's right folks, a chimp is still in it, ready to take home that sweet sweet <b>Banana Moon Pie</b></li>

<h1>Congratulations UCLA Spartans</h1>

<div class = "pre">
To: The Candymeister
From: John Housenga

I love all the support UCLA is getting this year. To be the 8th most commonly selected champion, despite an 11 seed and play in game, makes me wonder if they know something I don't. Good luck to those candy seakers as they root on their precious Spartans...I mean Bruins...to the victory.

Thanks,
John
</div>
<hr class = 'section' />

<p>
A little backstory. In 2011 the NCAA decided that 64 teams was not enough teams. So they created "The First Four", four games played <em>before</em> the main bracket of 64, with the winners advancing into the traditional 2^6 binary tree.
</p>
<p>As a programmer, especially one that spent I'm Not Telling You hours coding that 64-team bracket, my decision to just completely ignore the First Four was a sane one. Since Candy Seekers needed to put in their picks before those games were played, I would just put both teams in for the entry.
</p>
<p>For example, if Greendale Community College was playing Stratton College, I'd put Greendale/Stratton in the bracket entry. After that game was played (The Greendale Human Beings won in OT), I'd fix it in the JQMCBP database, giving anyone that selected Greendale/Stratton as a winner the benefit of the doubt that they'd really just meant Greendale.
</p>
<p>
So. An interesting thing happened this year. One of the First Four games was Michigan State/UCLA. UCLA won, and then just kept winning. Amazingly, as John pointed out, "UCLA" was the 8th most commonly selected champion, despite being seeded by the NCAA somewhere between the 44th and 47th best team.
</p>
<p>So what happened? The thing is, JQMCBP is KIND OF A BIG DEAL in Michigan. While many of the Michigander Faithful are Wolverine fans, there are also a fair number of Michigan Staters. And 10 of them thought <strike>Michigan State</strike> UCLA was going all the way. Of the 10 people that selected <strike>Michigan State</strike> UCLA, <em>8 reside in Michigan</em>.

<p>I reached out to one of the other two, Dr. Andrew Nicholson of Colorado, to get some clarification on his selection. He shared SO MUCH good intel, <em>especially</em> the bit about giving Earvin Johnson a parking violation.
</p>

<hr class = 'section' />
<div class = "pre">
To: The Candymeiser
From: Andrew Nicholson

I, of course, was picking a program that has a record of winning the tournament, a strong coaching tradition, and with many former players becoming NBA greats, especially with the Lakers.

Also, my college roommate's girlfriend dropped a Ticket on Magic's Rolls-Royce in 1982 in her work-study parking enforcement job on the MSU campus.

Frankly, I've been frazzled and not following college hoops much this year, and went with the homer pick and Nate Silver's theory, that Tom Izzo is the best tourney coach. Plus, MSU beat a couple of good teams before the tournament. Besides, my college girlfriend is from Iron Mountain in the UP, and knows him personally (oh, and her grandmother makes a mean pasty...the food item, not the clothing item, as expected in those old mining towns).

I actually thought UCLA was going to suck in the tourney.  Heck our local Colorado Buffs (keep expectations low and enjoy success) beat them relatively late in the season.

Thus, your theory holds. I've cc'd your old friend Grace, who hooked me into this wild thing and is trailing the "Rupert's Relations" group.

Thanks for your good work. 

Andrew

<h1>Losing Mascots: Let's Talk About Them!</h1>
<h2>Pointless Discussion about Losing Teams and Their Mascots</h2>

<p>
12 more mascots found their way out over the weekend (plus Monday and Tuesday, which I'm definitely not used to as being "basketball nights"). Here they are in order from lamest to awesomest:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Wildcats - Sorry Villanova. Be more specific! Vermont Catamounts, Missouri Tigers, The California University of Pennsylvania Fuzzy Kittens. These are good mascots. Wildcats: LAME.</li>
<li>Eagles - Oral Roberts, named after not-at-all-consumed-with-self-promotion evangelist Oral Roberts, could have done so much better. Don't get me wrong, Eagles are huge and awesome, I just think Oral could have dreamed bigger. 3 out of 5 stars. It was really fun watching their team though, this 4th place regular season Summit League team was legit.</li>
<li>Crimson Tide - I've gone off on this many times in year's past. There's nothing more terrifying than a <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_tide">Red Tide, a toxic floatilla of deadly dinoflagellates</a>. But, that's not what Crimson Tide means in this context, which makes it 100% not terrifying and instead lame and disregardable. That's right, I said it! Disregardable!</li>
<li>Seminoles - I think the world has spoken on the whole native-peoples-as-mascot thing. Seriously, even if you get sign off from the Seminole Tribe, I mean...you're a University in <em>Florida</em>. The state is a cautionary tale in geographic form. So many scary things to choose from! I know, the Gators are already taken, but...The FSU Invasive Pythons. The FSU Florida Man. The FSU Srsly Pick Any Florida Politician. The FSU <em>Actual Red Tide</em>.</li>
<li>Orangemen - He was voted out after one term and I am so so very done thinking about him, thankyouverymuch.</li>
<li>Trojans - It's fine. Here's a <a href = "http://gph.is/19ZL2fo">context-free GIF</a></li>
<li>Razorbacks - This is solid. It's not just a pig but a feral pig, a once-domestic pig now living off the land, as Pig God intended. According to wikipedia, Razorback also disambiguates as follows:
    <ul>
        <li>The fin whale</li>
        <li>Razorback (film), a 1984 Australian horror film</li>
        <li>Razorback (band), a Filipino rock band</li>
        <li>Arkansas Razorbacks, the names of college sports teams at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville, Arkansas</li>
        <li>USS Razorback, a World War 2 submarine</li>
        <li>West Sydney Razorbacks, an Australian professional basketball team</li>
        <li>Razorback2, a former server on the eDonkey filesharing network</li>
        <li><a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Razorback#/media/File:DeanRazorback.JPG">Dean Razorback, a guitar</a></li>
        <li>Razorback (comics), Buford Hollis, a comic book character introduced in the pages of Spectacular Spider-Man in 1977</li>
        <li>The Razorbacks, a Canadian rockabilly band</li>
        <li>Early models of Republic P-47 Thunderbolt fighter aircraft</li>
        <li>An unlockable item in Team Fortress 2</li>
        <li>Razorback, New South Wales, a locality in Australia</li>
        <li>Razorback, a hiking trail on Mount Feathertop in the Australian state of Victoria</li>
        <li>Russelsheim Razorbacks, a defunct American football Team from Russelsheim, Germany</li>
        <li>A beer by Ringwood Brewery</li>
        <li>A worker who loads and unloads train cars for a circus</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>Blue Jays - This is a pretty solid mascot. Smart bird. Wily. Loud. Mean. Living in Madison Wisconsin in the summer of 1993, a Blue Jay nested outside our back door, and dive-bombed me mercilessly. True story.</li>
<li>Ramblers - I did a whole thing on the Ramblers a few years ago. Though not all named for it, you should all go <a href = "https://youtu.be/nsmbkHvOaI0">get yourself a Rambler</a>!</li>
<li>Wolverines - I know, Michigan-faithful, your loss has to sting. Esp. losing to the Michigan State Bruins like that. But rest assured, the Wolverine remains one of the most fantastic of all college mascots. 50% bear, 50% cat, 100% awesome.</li>
<li>Beavers - A VERY solid mascot. Literally chews down trees. Cool tail. Is busy. Yet somehow, amazingly, only the second best mascot in the state of Oregon.</li>
<li>Ducks - There we go, the #1 mascot in Oregon, and in this list. Who needs the 1,000 Chimp Army when you've got the <a href = "https://youtu.be/nHc288IPFzk">1,000 DUCK ARMY?</a> QUACK!</li>

<h1>Candy Bar of the Day</h1>
<h2>Where I give out fake awards for my favorite candy selections</h2>

<p>
The Global Scatalogical Award
</p>
<p>
Today's award is a TIE between two candies from opposite sides of the globe. First, from Germany, we have Arsch mit Ohren. Jack Wenz's selection of Arsch mit Ohren translates from German to "Butt With Ears". Classy.
</p>
<p>
<a href = "https://www.amazon.de/Haribo-mit-Ohren-Dose-650g/dp/B004R5DH1I">This is Arsch Mit Ohren.</a> Unfortunately, this item is Derzeit nicht verfugbar, which either means it's not available or that I've broken some kind of international treaty.
</p>
<p>
Alongside our Audio-detecting Rear End auf Deutch we have Satoshi Nakamoto's selection of Moko Moko Mokoletto. The Japanese words Moko Moko Mokoletto translate to "Moko Moko Mokoletto". It's a toilet, and you eat the toilet water.
</p>
<p>
<a href = "https://youtu.be/lPLl8gHPFAY">This is Moko Moko Mokoletto</a>. I wasn't kidding. It's a toilet. You eat the toilet water.
</p>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, Arsch Mit Ohren and Moko Moko Mokoletto. Two great tastes that go great together!
</p>
<hr class = 'section' />
<h1>Bugging you for charity</h1>
<p>In case you haven't seen it on the website already, I'm riding my bike more miles than I'm fit to ride in June to support the MS society. The JQMCBP is always and forever 100% free, but if you're so inclined <a href = "https://mssociety.donordrive.com/participant/BenKlaas">you may donate buckets of cash to my ride here</a>. This is my 9th MS-150, and my goal remains the same: raise &gt;$1000 so I can access the VIP toilets, and to BEAT LARRY.

<p>
Shout out to the Isenhart clan, including Pondscum aka Aufwuchs aka Dr. Tom, one of the JQMCBP I Council of Nine. Serine and Tom are in 3rd and 5th place respectively. But alas, they have no chance at the candy. So close!
<p>
Mark Dyal has had an amazing run thus far and is 7 points clear on the entire field going into the Final Four. Nevertheless, he needs a Baylor win to bring home the Milky Way.
