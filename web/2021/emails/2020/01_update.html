<h1>
To My Loyal and Probably Anxious 370* Candy Seekers:<br />
</h1>
<p>
This thing was slated to get rolling Monday, but over the weekend I had a nagging shoulder condition go from bad to <i>SUPER OMG BAD</i>**.  My phone consult (no touching!) with an orthopedist said the technical term for my condition was "just really, really awful timing." This is something normally treated with a cortisone injection but they aren't giving those out any more because it lowers immunity. So now I'm the Chief Engineer on the Ibuprofen Train, and I'm happy to report that I've improved so much I can now barely type (from a bed, with laptop tilted at a weird angle to accomodate the sling).
</p>

<p>So, the actual "games" in this absurdist bracket have not started yet. When do they start? Good question. I'm not entirely sure, because see footnote**, but figure tomorrow or Thursday at the latest. I will be posting "updates" and possibly "highlights" of the "games" on Twitter, under the username <a href="https://twitter.com/candymeister">@candymeister</a>*** as they transpire. If you aren't a fan of the Twitter, and believe me I get that, it's a tire fire, never fear, the bulk of the important analysis will be in these emails.
</p>

<p>
For the rookies, what you should look forward to:<br />
What I do is send out email updates several times during the course of the tournament. I go on and on and on over seemingly meaningless minutia. It might seem meaningless but...well okay, it's meaningless. But we'll have fun, or your money back.*****
</p>

<p>
In addition to the emails, there's lots of important, vital resources available with your web browser. Evaluate how risky your picks are with the <a href = "https://benklaas.com/jqmcbp/whatsyourj.cgi">J Factor</a>, see who picked brackets like yours with the <a href = "https://benklaas.com/jqmcbp/sss.cgi">Scientific Similarity Index</a>. As the tournament progresses, figure out who has no chance of winning at the <a href = "https://benklaas.com/jqmcbp/hallofshame.cgi">Hall of Shame!</a> Generate pointless <a href = "https://benklaas.com/jqmcbp/hallofshame.cgi">head-to-head graphs</a>! Every one of my emails will contain these linky links at the bottom of the email or head to <a href = "https://benklaas.com/jqmcbp/leaderboard.cgi">The Leaderboard</a> as a jumping off point.
</p>

<p>
As I've done for the past few years, I'm sending emails through the appropriately named <a href = "https://mailchimp.com">MailChimp</a> mass email service. This is Lucky the Chimp's favorite email service, and because it actually sends emails that people tend to receive. However, MailChimp will not allow me to send multiple emails to the same email address. So, if you signed up several brackets on one email address, you only be getting one personalized email for each entry. How about we call this a "feature" and call an end to the tech talk.
</p>

<p>
* for now! technically I haven't shut entries down because**<br />
** OW MY SHOULDER
</p>

<p>
*** In my decreased typing capacity I will do my best to not make ludicrous spelling errors in my tweets like our Very Bad President****.
</p>

<p>
**** My bad, JQMCBP is an apolitical entity. Let me correct that: our Very <b>Very</b> Bad President. That's better.

***** Refund applications need to be filed in triplicate and mailed to the Johnny Quest Memorial Candy Bar Pool Customer Service Department, care of its Parent Corporation, Slaptronics Personal Massage Therapy and Self Help Video Distribution Corporation of Netherland Antilles (nasdaq:SPMTSHVDCNA). Or you could contact your congressperson, which will give you a similar outcome.

<h1>Bugging you for charity</h1>
<p>In case you haven't seen it on the website already, I'm riding 150 miles to support the MS society in (hopefully post-quarantine) June. The JQMCBP is always and forever 100% free, but if you're so inclined <a href = "https://main.nationalmssociety.org/goto/beat_larry_2020">you may donate buckets of cash to my ride here</a>. This is my 9th MS-150, and my goals remain the same: raise &gt;$1000 so I can access the VIP toilets, and to BEAT LARRY.

<p>
cheers,<br />
the Meister
