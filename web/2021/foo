Patty-

I don't know if this will make a mass email update, but here's the initial J factor analysis.
2018 is the highest J Factor year of the actual bracket, though 2014 was way up there too.
(I went and looked at it, and it makes sense, there were all kinds of crazy upsets in round 1...Harvard, North Dakota State, etc.).
I'm also surprised at how high the J factor turns out to be for the actual bracket. Much higher than humans in all years but 2009, which was very "chalky".

cheers,
The Meister
