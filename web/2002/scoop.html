<FONT SIZE=+1>The whole point of this thing is
fun and candy. Unlike other office NCAA pools, this one won't have you
stressed out about the $1-$5 you are going to lose because you picked Holy Cross in the upset of the decade. The stakes are candy, and you can't lose. Just
click on the admission ticket below and start making your selections. 

<P>Make your picks by clicking on the
button by each of your projected winning teams. Submit each page of your
choices by clicking on the GO BEN GO! button at the bottom of the form.
If you want to go back to change any selections, just click &quot;Back&quot;
on your browser and make your changes. Just make sure that you submit these
changes with the GO BEN GO! button to process your new picks. Fill in each
round's picks, and select a candy bar, and that's it! Game On!

<P>
<a href="javascript:popUp('/johnnyquest/images/lucky.gif')">Lucky the Chimp</a>, our loyal mascot,
is back again with his random coin-flip generated picks for the contest. 
Lucky had a dream run last year, picking Duke to win it all (which they did). Although his other picks didn't do so well, he still beat a <a href="javascript:popUp('lucky_losers.html')">huge number of entrants.</a>
<p>


<!--Last year was business as usual for dear <a href="javascript:popUp('/johnnyquest/images/lucky.gif')">Lucky</a>, finishing dead last again. In fact, the only time <a href="javascript:popUp('/johnnyquest/images/lucky.gif')">Lucky</a> has finished anywhere other than last place was 1999, when he handed the Grand Loser crown to Chris Jones for his amazingly non-random but incredibly awful picks.<p> 
I ask you to please be kind to <a href="javascript:popUp('/johnnyquest/images/lucky.gif')">Lucky</a>, because he has had so many problems. Currently, <a href="javascript:popUp('/johnnyquest/images/lucky.gif')">Lucky</a> is violating probation and going on the road with this year's NCAA tournament. <a href="javascript:popUp('/johnnyquest/images/lucky.gif')">Lucky</a> seems to think that being closer to his random picks will help him be victorious in this year's pool. I am dubious, but intend to use <a href="javascript:popUp('/johnnyquest/images/lucky.gif')">Lucky</a> as a roving correspondent for this year's tourney. Stay tuned... 
<p>
<a href="javascript:popUp('/johnnyquest/images/lucky.gif')">Lucky</a> assures me, however, that his battles with the formidable Chris Jones are not over.
