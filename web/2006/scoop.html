<p>
The whole point of this thing is fun and candy. Unlike other office NCAA pools, this one won't have you
stressed out about the $1-$5 you are going to lose because you picked Delaware State in the upset of the decade. The stakes are candy, and you can't lose. Just
click on the candy bar button below and start making your selections. 

<P>Make your picks by clicking on the
button by each of your projected winning teams. When you make your selection, JQMCBP BracketMagic&#8482; will automatically move your selection to the next round.  
If you want to change any selections, just click on the red 'x' to the right of the team name and it will send it back a round for further scrutiny.

After you fill in your entire bracket, you will be prompted for the crucial part of your entry, your candy bar selection. Click on the Go! Ben! Go! button and your bracket is complete!

<P><a href = "http://www.sportsline.com/collegebasketball/mayhem/brackets/printable_men">Printable</a> and <a href="http://www.sportsline.com/collegebasketball/mayhem/brackets/viewable_men">Viewable</a> brackets are available from 
the NCAA, however once the tourney starts you will be able to view your selections Supa-Fancy Style&#8482; from <a href="/cgi-bin/player_bracket_selection.cgi">benklaas.com</a>. 


<P>So, that's the scoop. As in past years, I will religiously send out irreverant email rants as the tournament progresses, thus lowering your work productivity and allowing you to spend countless hours following teams like the Musketeers of Xavier, the Salukis of Southern Illinois, the Golden Flashes of Kent State, and of course the future NCAA champion Aztecs of San Diego State.
