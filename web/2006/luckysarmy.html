<h1 class = 'enter'>Lucky's 1000 Chimp Army</h1>

<br>Not satisfied with his personal-best 2001 performance as his crowning JQMCBP achievement, 
		<img src = '/johnnyquest/images/chimparmy.jpg' style = "float: left; margin: 15 15 5 0;">
<a href = 'lucky.html'>Lucky the Chimp</a> has assembled 1000 of the toughest, roughest, most notorious Chimps to aid in his cause. There's Dario the Chimp, wanted for extradition by the government of Panama for Produce Fraud; Fatima the Chimp, deemed 'untreatable and clearly psychopathic' by her primate psychologists at the Univerisity of Wisconsin; Diego the Chimp, implicated as the mastermind in several mass zoo escapes. 
			<img src = '/johnnyquest/images/chimparmy2_flipped.jpg' style = "float: right; margin: 10 0 5 10;">
The other 997 are even worse, and ALL of them are entering this year's JQMCBP (each with their own randomly generated picks), as part of Lucky's 1000 Chimp Army.
<p>Your success against Lucky's Army will be tracked with your <a href = '/johnnyquest/images/darwinscore.jpg'>Darwin Score</a>, a measure of how many of the Army are currently beating you (tie goes to the chimp). A Score of 0 defines you squarely as a member of <a href = 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Colbert'><i>Homo sapiens</i></a>, 500 means you aren't much different than <a href= 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Chimpanzee'><i>Pan troglodytes</i></a>, and a score of 1000 demonstrates that you scientifically identical to <a href = 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swamp_white_oak'><i>Quercus bicolor</i></a>.
