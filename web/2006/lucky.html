<p>
To introduce newcomers to the JQMCBP, <a href="javascript:popUp('/johnnyquest/images/lucky.gif')">Lucky the Chimp</a> is our loyal mascot and favorite repeat offender (see below). He's back again with his random coin-flip-generated picks for the contest, although this time he's brought his <a href = 'luckysarmy.html'>POSSE</a>.
<p>

Lucky had a dream run in 2001, picking Duke to win it all (which they did). Although his other picks didn't do so well, he still beat a <a href="javascript:popUp('lucky_losers.html')">huge number of entrants.</a>. 
<p>This year Lucky has assembled his <a href = 'luckysarmy.html'>1000 CHIMP ARMY</a> in an effort exact justice for his years of futile efforts.
