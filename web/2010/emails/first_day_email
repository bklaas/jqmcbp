Welcome to JQMCBP XIV!

660 brave humans, and 1001 chimps (Lucky plus his 1000 chimp army) have decided that the JQMCBP is a good use of their time. 

According to my database, there are about 157 rookies to the pool this year. Welcome to the insanity! To fill you on on what to expect here, what I do is send out email updates several times during the course of the tournament, going on and on and on over the seemingly meaningless minutia of things. They might seem meaningless but...well okay, they're meaningless. But we'll have fun, or your money back.*

In addition to the emails, there's lots of important, vital resources available with your web browser. Check out the links at the bottom of the email or head to http://benklaas.com/jqmcbp/leaderboard.cgi as a jumping off point.

* Refund applications need to be filed in triplicate and mailed to the Johnny Quest Memorial Candy Bar Pool Customer Service Department, care of its Parent Corporation, Slaptronics Personal Massage Therapy and Self Help Video Distribution Corporation of Netherland Antilles (nasdaq:SPMTSHVDCNA). Or you could contact your congressperson, which will give you a similar outcome.

NEW: Barack's Baracket

Believe it or not, President Barack Obama has entered this year's Candy Bar Pool. Or rather, his bracket has...President Obama really did fill out a bracket (seriously, I'm not kidding: http://tinyurl.com/d8gcho), and I've gotten access to his picks and entered them in JQMCBP. You can view how your performance rates with the Commander in Chief here:

I googled for "barack obama favorite candy bar" and found an answer*. The interwebs know everything. I'm pretty sure there's no need to get edumacated any more.

* smoked salted caramels (Michelle prefers dark chocolate salted caramels)

Upsets...who picked 'em -- 

Three years in a row we've had a first day of games without a significant upset. American U looked ready to knock off Villanova, but they and all of the other heavy underdogs all failed in their quest.

The closest thing we had to an upset was #12 Western Kentucky (The Hilltoppers) over the #5 Illini of Illinois. Considering 180 of you had that one right, it's a stretch to call that one an upset. Did you happen to see the mascot for WKU? He, she, it, whatever...is FANTASTIC. If you missed "Big Red", there are many pictures available on the interwebs: http://tinyurl.com/dbf7pj

Shout Outs 
where I pseudo-randomly (by which I mean not randomly at all) give a shout out to one or many of you, my loyal pool contestants.

This first Shout Out is going not to a pool contestant, but to an actual player in the tournament. While his Alabama State team did not win the silly "play-in" game the NCAA has to determine the final team in the field of 64, his name gains him immediate appointment to the All-Time All-Name team, joining such past players as Fennis Dembo and Godd Shamgodd. I give you, standing 7-foot 1-inch tall, starting ASU center Grlenntys Chief Kickingstallionsims Jr.!

For me it's the "jr." that really makes that name. Poetry...and Mein Gott, that means there's a Grlenntys Chief Kickingstallionsims Sr.!!

Mailbag

From dedicated candy seeker and dear pal Carrie O'Boyle, her musings on the 3 Musketeers Bar, or rather ANYONE WHO MIGHT DARE CHOOSE ONE:
"If someone asks for a 3 Musketeers, they might automatically be removed from my friends list. (Not just on Facebook, but my real friends list. I have one you know.) Lamest candy bar ever. Who wants to eat all nougat? Not me, that's for sure." 

Want to be friends with Carrie? Choose wisely.

Send me funny things! I just might print them! When you get published in a JQMCBP email, it's like you've finally made it*

*it
Pronunciation: \Ëˆit\

You're it!

Fun With Data -- 

660 entries this year marks the first participant decline in the history of JQMCBP. In these troubled economic times, however, it is important to manage expectations and realize that consumers need to make hard decisions before investing in something as risky as a completely free candy bar pool. Oddly, my marketing budget of BIG FAT NOTHING has remained steady for 14 years, so while my inclination is to always blame the marketing department (typically a good strategy), it's hard to place blame there. As a result of the decline, JQMCBP's parent corporation, Slaptronics Personal Massage Therapy and Self Help Video Distribution Corporation of Netherland Antilles (nasdaq:SPMTSHVDCNA) was down 29% in after market trading.

Candy Bar of the Day --
where I single out one or two of my favorite candy selections

The I-Must-Google-This-Now Award

Eric Nordin from Canada (sportsman's paradise), for choosing Mo's Bacon Bar. Wait a minute...chocolate AND bacon? Is such a synergy possible? I must google this. Now.

Look no further than the adrenaline-infused needcoffee.com for this huh-it-really-isn't-ficticious candy bar:

Enough with the crap, who's ahead? -- 

Ah, the normal distribution. Ain't it grand? With 660 entries, you can still count on only a few people rising to the top after only a short time. Congrats to Jason "whatchamacallit" Howland and Tim "Cadbury Flake Bar" Thomas for successfully flipping coins with perfect accuracy.
