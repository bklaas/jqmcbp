<h1>The Chimps Long Slow Slide into Randomness</h1>

<p>
This is going to be a quick one as I was out for the second night in a row until 2:30 a.m. for no particularly good reason. Honestly, I am way too old for that kind of behavior. Friday night I went to this place called the <a href = "http://riddle-room.com/about/">Riddle Room</a> with a gaggle of old college friends. The Riddle Room is a place where, I am not making this up, you are given you no instructions whatsoever, locked into a room that would make an OSHA inspector lose sleep, and told "You have one hour. GO!". And YOU pay THEM!* We solved it in 40 minutes though**, thankyouverymuch, which gave us a solid 20 minutes to discuss building codes and safety violations. Then we had tacos.
</p>

<p>
In the depths of head-shaking over Iowa State's loss Thursday, I completely neglected to go into detail of the brightest shining moment of the tournament thus far, 
<a href = "https://youtu.be/OmcOo-bGJp0">the COMPLETELY BONKERS finish to the Georgia State - Baylor game</a>. If you haven't seen the ending, it's a superb 12 seconds to watch. The best though, THE BEST, is
<a href = "https://vine.co/v/OYuxbrz33Ub">the Premiere Coach's Reaction To A Last Second Win Ever</a>. This coach just a week previous had torn his achilles tendon celebrating their Sun Belt Conference tournament championship, so he had to come up with a better way to show his enthusiasm. He did. <a href = "https://twitter.com/GaStateGolf/status/578647215092183041">Even the Georgia State Golf Team was REALLY excited about this win</a>. So, if you're favorite team is already vanquished****, you've got a new squad to root for.
</p>

<p>
The Friday games were soooo much less interesting than the one described above, and it may have been the least eventful in recent JQMCBP memory. Very few (4) players lost their champions, almost all of the favorites won, and as a result the first day conquest of the 1000 Chimp Army, led by Julien the Chimp, will likely go down as a footnote***** in the JQMCBP history books.

Amazingly, only 4 people lost their champion picks on Friday. Surprised that Robert Morris didn't get past Duke, as was Mark Jones. Turns out one guy named Bob Morris just does not stack up against a team full of elite college basketball players.

Similarly, only 16 lost their alma maters in yesterday's play. This includes Meredith "My 2014 Performance Has Not Gone To My Head; Nope, Not One Bit" Hammons, graduate of Davidson. Also, a close loss for possibly the best mascot of the tourney*, the Anteaters of UC Irvine, sent Senora Espero's hopes for her university packin'.

<h1>Candy Bar of the Day</h1>
<h2>where I single out one or two of my favorite candy selections</h2>

<p>
A tribute to the parenthetical, one of my favorite tangential literary devices*, here are the special instructions that a sampling of the 14 parenthetical JQMCBPers gave me, should they win their candy (which they likely won't), and my parenthetical response (because why not).
</p>
<div class = 'pre'>
Jeb "carrot sticks (organic)" Byers
(carrots ain't candy, less so when pesticide-free)

theodore "large bottle of coke (its kinda a candy right ben) chungath
(yeah. kinda.)

Andrew "sour skittles (share size)" Anderson
(sharing is caring. Andrew, I'm proud of you today)

Chris "Kit Kat (Old School)
(So sick of kids today with their new-fangled fancy Snickers and Milky Way. I remember when all we had was Kit Kat and we LIKED IT and IT WAS GOOD. Those were the days.)

Bill "Root Beer (only) Bottle Caps" McGrail
(this feels like the dressing room request of a self-absorbed 1970s metal guitarist)

James "Snickers (king size if available)" Doyle
(fascinatingly, it <a href = "http://money.cnn.com/2012/02/17/news/companies/snickers_calories/index.htm">kind of isn't</a>)

Michael "White Reeces (thass racist Liz Lemon!)" Ferreter
(yep, 30 Rock was a good show)

WendyLou "M&Ms in a coot** candy jar (google it)"
(I DID WENDYLOU AND IT DOESN'T EXIST)

Fran "Every Burger (Google it)" Fabrizio
(I have no doubt Google has all of the burgers)

</div>

Well, you've read this far so you must be a kind soul.
