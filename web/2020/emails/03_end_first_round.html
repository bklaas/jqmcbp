	WELL HELLOOOO. It's been a while. Yes, the cadence is a bit slower than during basketball
	years. But, I remind you, We've Got Nothing But Time (WGNBT). We're at the end of First 
	Round of JQMCBP XXIII and, as is typical, we've got some people doing well, most people 
	doing "medium", and some people doing quite poorly.

Hey Candymeister, when can I expect the next "games" to be played?
</div>

<p>
Still a good question, fictional person! How about this weekend? No promises!
</p>

<p>Remember, anything underlined below in this email is a link! The screenshots of youtube videos are links! You can follow them! WGNBT!</p>

<hr class = 'section' />
<h1><a href = "https://youtu.be/Of8JOVXYU0Q">Wha' Happened?</a></h1>
<h2>Going in deep on some of the "games"</h2>

<p>
The First Round concluded with "games" in the Cover Songs, Odd Mammals, Punk Birds, and Carson's Picks regions. Here's the breakdown:
</p>

<h3>Cover Songs Region</h3>

<p>First off, I am SUPER into Rodrigo y Gabriela. The closest I've come in my adult life
	to fisticuffs came at a Rodrigo y Gabriela concert when a guy in the row behind me
	refused to stop clapping off-rhythm and got beligerent when I asked him to stop. True story!
	Anyway, they are just absolutely amazing, and if you've not heard of them I'd suggest you watch <a href = "https://youtu.be/KV2ixprDrK8">
	this</a> or <a href = "https://youtu.be/4g-Z13qTcBA">this</a> or <i>wow</i> <a href = "https://youtu.be/wKd0HNg1kFQ">this</a>.
"This" said, the completely randomly found <a href = "https://youtu.be/fOmcF3bOgHQ">TRUE EPIC RUSSIAN COVER</a> of Metallica's 
instrumental Orion is something to behold: traditionaly eastern european string instruments,
an accordion, and a bear-suited guitarist. RUSSIANS WIN!
</p>


<p>
The classic 1980s song "Africa" by Toto was covered in the first round by two very different
efforts. On the one side, there was this <a href = "https://youtu.be/MH9FyLsfDzw">EPIC METAL COVER</a>
by this Norwegian guy named Leo and his friend Hanna. IT RULES. On the other
side, you have Weezer, who do absolutely nothing to make their cover interesting. I know
there are probably some Weezer fans out there* in JQMCBP land, and I'm sorry. Sorry for what, you say?
Sorry for this lame cover? Sorry for being a Weezer fan? Sorry for your loss? All of the above?
I mean, Weezer is fine (I guess?). But this cover is the worst. HEAVY METAL AFRICA WINS.
</p>

<p>* like Matt Damon in this SNL skit. "I'm ride or die!" "...for <i><b>Weezer</b></i>?"</p>
<a href="https://youtu.be/ab5WvwfLuLM">

	<style type="text/css"> @media only screen and (max-width:480px){.emailImage{height:auto!important;max-width:600px!important;width:100%!important}}</style>

<p><b>Next up:</b> Immigrant Songs. Or is it Immigrants Song? Anyway, this iconic song about 
	Vikings doing something awesome has been reproduced...just a few times:
<ul>
	<li><a href = "https://youtu.be/BvYsygyVjqo">Zeparella</a></li>
	<li><a href = "https://youtu.be/1J7KUCthzUE">This Guy</a></li>
	<li><a href = "https://youtu.be/7KFFpyP2QiU">This Other Guy (srsly Will.I.Am., what's your problem)</a></li>
	<li><a href = "https://youtu.be/Kg1mlBhRnTM">Tenacious D and Foo Fighters and Slash and WAT RLY?</a></li>
	<li><a href = "https://youtu.be/BsQ0EcKntMI">THIS KID</a></li>
	<li><a href = "https://youtu.be/4X5AID_c4ss">Mothers of Mayhem</a></li>
	<li><a href = "https://youtu.be/cZzdYqBf8Mc">Sure why not a rubber chicken</a></li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>For Immigrants Song, our competition pitted a really cool <a href = "https://youtu.be/KxEi3pd5xvk">lo-fi version</a>
against one that is not actuall a cover but just the original recoring over a very lo-fi animation
of kittens sailing across the land of the ice and snow from the midnight sun where the hot 
springs blow. <a href = "https://youtu.be/ApxnAr6pRt0">KITTENS WIN!</a></p>

<p>Lastly in the Cover Songs region, we have the song Smooth Criminal covered in two very
	different ways. First, a really interesting <a href = "https://youtu.be/bU47K11-wNs">acapella rendition</a> by some outfit called 
	Duwende. It's good! I mean no disrespect, people that shun instruments!
    Second, we have more or less the definitive <a href = "https://youtu.be/CDl9ZMfj6aE">THIS IS WHAT A COVER SONG SHOULD BE</a> version by
	Alien Ant Farm. AAF WINS! Also, the masked dancing kid is so apropos!
</p>
<h3>Odd Mammals Region</h3>

<p>Some of you may know, and most of you don't, that while I am a mild-mannered programmer by day, I 
	hide a secret past: <i>mammalogist</i>. It's true, I used to study wee furry critters as 
	a full-time gig. In fact, when the very first JQMCBP was launched, it was during my grad school days studying
	the Plains Pocker Gopher, Meadow Voles, and other assorted critters on a NW Iowa Prairie. <a href = "https://academic.oup.com/jmammal/article/79/3/942/859313">
		For</a> <a href ="https://www.jstor.org/stable/3683026?seq=1">realsies!</a>
</p>
<p>
But now the year is 2020, and what we care about is WHAT MAMMALS SURVIVED in the round of 64
of JQMCBP XXIII.
</p>
<p>First up! Pangolin vs. Mountain Beaver. The Mountain Beaver is a weird, cool, and certainly ODD one.
	Unrelated closely to pretty much anything (not even beavers), the Apolodontia aka 
	Mountain Beaver of the Pacific Northwest certainly checks all the boxes. Unforutnately,
	it went up against the Pangolin, an absurd cross between an anteater and an armadillo. PANGOLIN WINS!
</p>

<p>Next up! The Battle of the Flyings! The Flying Fox could have been a significant organism
	in my professional life. True story, at the conclusion of my M.S. in Ecology I applied
	to work on a Flying Fox research project in the Northern Marianas islands in the South Pacific.
	Had I been hired...well, things would have gone quite a bit different, wouldn't it.
	But I didn't get that job, and therefore...FLYING SQUIRREL WINS!
</p>

<p>What's next? Oh, Tarsier vs. Aye-Aye. They are both so. very. strange.
	Aye-Aye's have tremendous, extended middle fingers. Tarsier's have the largest eye-to-face
	ratios of any mammal. TARSIER WINS!</p>

<p>Last up! This one was tough. As a former rodent biologist, it's hard not to like 
	the engergetic bipedal madness of the <a href = "https://youtu.be/KHxfzDQguqI">Kangaroo Rat</a>. But, even harder not to like 
	is the murderous intenstity of the Grasshopper Mouse, Killer of Scorpions, Killer of 
	Mice, and <a href = "https://youtu.be/1K9mO5QzOIQ?t=98">Prolific Howler</a>. GRASSHOPPER MOUSE WINS!
</p>
<h3>Punk Birds Region</h3>

<p>The Punk Birds region presents tough selections. So many birds with bad attitudes! But, 
	we need victors. Let's do this.
</p>
<h5>Australian Magpie vs. Monkey-eating Eagle</h5>
<p>Monkey-eating Eagles eat monkeys. This is exceptionally punk and a deep misreading of
	the evolutionary ladder. Australian Magpies have a website dedicated to 
	<a href = "https://www.magpiealert.com">mapping attacks on people</a>. Point in the 
	magpie's favor. Also, and I shouldn't need to remind you of this, <a href = "https://youtu.be/YGGTcYfrEZU?t=68">
	THE EYES DON'T WORK THE EYES DON'T WORK GET MUM GET MUM THE EYES DON'T WORK</a>. MAGPIE WINS!
     </p>
<h5>Greater Roadrunner vs. Common Cuckoo</h5>
<p>Common cuckoos are brood parasites, laying their eggs in other birds nests for them 
	to raise, like the punks
	they are. Greater Roadrunners, which are also cuckoos, eat rattlesnakes. Beep! Beep! ROADRUNNER WINS!
</p>
<h5>American Dipper vs. Cassowary</h5>
<p>The Cassowary is literally known as The Murder Bird, with 5" claws that it uses as a weapon
	that has more than once killed people. It's quite punk. The Water Ouzel, aka the American
	Dipper, is a songbird that has adapted to diving into fast-moving streams to catch little 
	bugs. DIPPER WINS!</p>
<h5>Shrike vs. Lammergaier</h5>

<p>This was easily the hardest of the Punk Birds region to select a winner. Shrikes impale
	their prey, be it bugs or lizards or even other birds, on thorns or even barbed wire. It's very punk.
	
	Lammergeiers, or Bearded Vultures, eat bones. That's it, just bones. Not the flesh off the bones. Bones. They drop e.g. goat femurs from high heights in the Ethiopian mountains, shattering them on the rocks below, then picking up (still large) bone bits and swallowing them whole. They have evolved special digestive juices so acidic they dissolve the bone quickly, making for a nutritious meal of BONES. Also they paint themselves with red mud to make themselves look more badass. As if this were necessary.
</p>
<p>I couldn't choose, so I <a href = "https://youtu.be/MqLK9vFSnqY">did another coin flip.</a> SHRIKE WINS!</p>
<h3>Carson's Picks Region</h3>

<p>Well, well, well. In the Carson's picks region, Carson gets to decide everything. It's like
	dinner, only with 100% less vegetables.</p>

<p>Here's our outcomes: Kolton Wong double play over Roger Federer, CC McGraw over Sepak Takraw,
	McKayla Maroney over Steph Curry, and probably the most WAT of all, Stephen Bradbury over
	Carli Lloyd.
</p>
<p>Upset? Confused? Here is 
	<a href = "https://soundcloud.com/candy-meister/interview-with-carson-on-first-round-picks">a possibly over-extensive interview with Carson</a>
about her choices.</p>

<h1>How Them Humans Doing?</h1>
<h2>Checking in on the 375ish Human(ish) Entries</h2>

<p>
Carson "I choose 1/8 of the bracket winners thankyouverymuch" Klaas sat in the fabled cat-bird's seat
through most of the latter half of the first round, until finally being overcome by the triumvarite of
Scott "The White Lion!" Mortimer, Cormac "Big Box of Nerds" O'Boyle, and Mark "Take 5" Richards. They
are all at 25, with Carson one back at 24, and a host of others just behind that. It's anyone's game*!
</p>
<p>* Perhaps not Mary "Hershey's Cookies and Creme" James. At 7 points and an RtT of 27, I'm afraid she 
	may be the first in the JQMCBP <a href = "https://benklaas.com/jqmcbp/hallofshame.cgi">Hall of Shame</a>.
</p>
<hr class = 'section' />
<h1>How Them Chimps Doing?</h1>
<h2>Checking in on the 1,000 Chimp Army</h2>

<p>Allie the Chimp has coin-flipped her way into a first round tie
	for the top with the humans at 25. Stacey the Chimp sitting pretty one back at 24. Seven
more chimps at 23. It. could. be. their. year. </p>
<hr class = 'section' />
<h1>How's That Shoulder Doing?</h1>

<p>What shoulder? Srsly, so much better. This late-night typing is really helping, too.</p>

<h1>Whose champion bit it?</h1>
<h2>Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose, but it never sucks worse than when the team you picked to win it all loses it all. It's even worse when I publish it for all to read!</h2>

<p>
Another 57 of you lost your champ in the second half of the first round, including several the-only-people-that-picked-em:
<ul>
	<li>Maggie "Weezer: RIDE OR DIE" Topel</li>
	<li>Chris "Chillin' to this Immigrant Song" Evasius</li>
	<li>Avey "Flying Fox: It's A Giant Bat, What's Not To Like?" Anderson</li>
	<li>Doug "How could you pick a random russian band over Rodrigo y Gabriela" Williams</li>
	<li>Scott "I'll Sepak YOUR Takraw" Johnson</li>
	<li>Tracy "Lammergaiers eat whole bones. BONES." Niyo</li>

<h1>Candy Bar of the Day</h1>
<h2>Where I give out fake awards for my favorite candy selections</h2>

<p>The Is This Really A Thing Award. Okay, Jon Blake, ya got me. Is "Hammond's Pigs-N-Taters Chocolate Bar" really a thing?
	*checks internet*. <a href = "https://www.vermontcountrystore.com/hammonds-pigs-n-taters-chocolate-bar-4-bars/product/H4705">IT'S A THING!</a>

<h1>Bugging you for charity</h1>

<p>In case you haven't seen it on the website already, I'm riding 150 miles to support the MS society in (hopefully post-quarantine) June. The JQMCBP is always and forever 100% free, but if you're so inclined <a href = "https://main.nationalmssociety.org/goto/beat_larry_2020">you may donate buckets of cash to my ride here</a>. This is my 9th MS-150, and my goals remain the same: raise &gt;$1000 so I can access the VIP toilets, and to BEAT LARRY.</p>
