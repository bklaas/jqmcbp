<h2>An Important Public Service Announcement:</h2>
<pre class='email_pre'>

To: The Candymeister <jqmcbp@gmail.com>
From: 2018 JQMCBP Champion Super Grover

Candymeister –

With the nearing of the 2019 JQMCBP, I feel it is my duty following last year’s series of unfortunate events to inform all participants in this year’s friendly JQMCBP that they should be cognizant of the consequences of their booty selection (aka their BootyRequest™). A foolish or otherwise ignorant BootyRequest™ could result in any number of negative outcomes, from social exclusion to numerous bouts of indigestion. 

A quick synopsis of the unfortunate events follows: I received my Black and Gold Musk-Flavoured sticks (after a long search by the Meister) and in the spirit of the JQMCBP I ate (or attempted to share) every single one of them. Here are some findings/consequences of my BootyRequest™. No, the “U” in “flavoured” does not impart any additional deliciousness. Yes, they tasted like grandma’s perfume mixed with potpourri.  No, I am no longer friends with those I shared the sticks with. Yes, they have the potential to be a great prank candy.  Yes, they have the consistency of chalk. No, they do not make your bowel movements smell any better. Yes, I now become nauseous around musk, be it real OR flavoured. And finally, NO, I will not make a foolish  BootyRequest™ this year.

To further explain why I will paraphrase Bryan Mills. The Meister doesn’t know who you are. The Meister doesn’t know what you want. If you are looking for ransom I can tell you that the Meister doesn’t have money, but what he does have are a very particular set of skills. Skills he has acquired over a very long career. Skills that make him a nightmare for people like you (actually me). If you request a simple candy bar now, that'll be the end of it. The Meister will not look for you, the Meister will not pursue you, but if you request an obscure or offensive culinary treat, he will look for it for you, he will find it and send it to you,  and it very well may kill you.

Simply put, be mindful of your BootyRequest™.   

Super Grover
