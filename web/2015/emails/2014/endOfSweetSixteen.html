Michigan and Michigan State are both still alive in the tourney, and since <a href = "http://benklaas.com/jqmcbp/graphs/locale.html">I'm huge in Michigan</a> many of you still have some home-state interest in the tournament. JQMCBP also has a significant Iowa contingent, as I'm both a native of Ames, Iowa and have an M.S. from Iowa State. Most of the Iowa contingent were rooting for the Fred Hoiberg-coached Iowa State Cyclones in their Friday night loss to Connecticut. Fred is already as big of a celebrity as you can be in Ames, Iowa, a graduate and star player from both Ames High and Iowa State. In the last week he's become a darling of the sports media for his <a href = "http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2003350-iowa-state-coach-fred-hoiberg-dances-in-locker-room-after-beating-unc">awesome dance moves and texted apology to his daughter</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Since the Cyclones, and with it the JQMCBP hopes of so many (34 had ISU as their champion, 51 listed them as their alma mater) are gone, I thought this would be a good time to tell a couple stories about how Fred Hoiberg destroyed my career as a basketball player.
</p>

<h2>How Fred Hoiberg Destroyed my Basketball Career</h2>
<p>
Circa 1987, I had a misplaced dream that I could become a viable competitive basketball player. In pursuit of this dream, I attended a weekend basketball clinic at Ames High School sponsored by former ISU guard Jeff Hornacek*. Midway through one of the scrimmages that day, I was on a team playing Fred Hoiberg's** team. Fred had just grabbed a rebound or stolen the ball or some such thing that Fred did well, and was leading a fast break the other way. I*** got it into my head that I was going to steal the ball by running up from behind and swiping it from him Jeff Moe-style*****. Oh, I forgot to mention this game was being played in the "new gym" at Ames High, which had the technological innovation of a poured rubber floor. This floor had about as much slickness as you'd expect from a floor made of poured rubber. As I made a flying horizontal leap to swipe the ball away, it was one of those moments where you felt like it was happening in slow motion. It was only mid-slow-mo flight that I noticed that Fred was not in slow-motion and continuing to dribble down the court in real time. Then I slow-mo skidded on the rubber floor, missing the steal by...well it wasn't close. As Fred, about a 9th grader at that point, dunked the ball on the other end, I was given adequate time to reflect on the hip-to-ankle floor burn I sustained as well as my future as an AHS varsity basketball player.
</p>
<p>

Fast forward to 1989. I had given up my dream of playing varsity, but I was captain of one of AHS's most formidable intramural basketball teams. Granted, we only played other schmoes from our school, but the league championship was played in front of the entire student body of about 1,500, so it still felt like kind of a big deal. My team was in the semifinals, only one victory away from playing before a (mandatory attendance) capacity crowd. Our opponent was a team made up of mostly linemen from the football team (at least one of whom is entered in JQMCBP this year). Before the game started, we were given the choice of playing on the full varsity court or "cross court", which is much shorter end-to-end. Somehow we convinced the wide bodies on the other team that full court was the only way to play, and by halftime we were comfortably ahead. This semifinal game was not attended by 1,500 people. More like 10. But one of them was Fred Hoiberg, who at halftime was talked into coming out and showing off his dunking skills******. Fred reluctantly took the ball, made his approach for the dunk...and while throwing it down <em>violently shattered the backboard</em>. My starting forward, JQMCBP veteran Matt "Elbows and Knees" Smalling, within seconds excitedly ran out on the court, collecting pieces of broken glass in his Super Kwik Kwencher******* and telling everyone animatedly how much the broken glass was going to be worth someday. After the excitement settled (and Fred sheepishly made his exit), we still had the second half of basketball to play, and since we just lost one of the hoops we were forced to play cross-court. The linemen, now not so winded, employed their second half strategy of putting up a solid wall of linemen around the basket to thwart all attempts at layups, rebounds, or anything else a normally-widthed person might do within 10 feet of the hoop. They eked out a victory, marking the second time in two years Fred had shattered my dreams. This time quite literally shattered.

</p>
<p>
That said, I was rooting hard for the Cyclones yesterday, because that Fred. He's such a nice boy.

...this is a statistic that tells me after the first weekend of games that I have absolutely no chance of winning? Whose the brainchild that thought this was a good idea? Have a little compassion, man! Can we please just have the second weekend of games to believe that we might have a chance, even if we don't? Is it too much to ask to get a week to look at our brackets with a sense of wonder, thinking that maybe, just maybe, if things go right, we might be able to win some candy? Way to crush our spirits after one weekend, YOU COW!

Aside from that, thanks for entertaining us and keep up the great work. Good times. Good times.

I think you've captured the spirit of UCOW very well. The JQMCBP is at heart a dictatorship, so it is often pointlessly cruel and inhuman. I'd apologize for that, but dictators don't say they are sorry.

On a positive note, I have not invaded Ukraine, nor plan to. At least for this fiscal quarter.

cheers,
The Meister

<h1>Candy Bar of the Day</h1>
<h2>where I single out one or two of my favorite candy selections</h2>

<p>
The What About the Children award goes to Colin Gjervold, for his selection of "Candy cigs with powdered sugar smoke". I used to buy these as a kid. They all had fake brands that were close to the names of real cigarettes. I always favored the candy cig brand "Hey, Man! KOOL!" because I felt the powdered sugar smoke had a certain piquant after-dinner flavor that went so well with my Bubs Daddy bubblegum and RC Cola* from Skelly gas station. Brent Dakin, if you're reading this far, you know I'm right. You were out there in the parking lot "smoking" with me.

Tim "Snickers" Ogborn of Illinois has taken over sole possession of the lead, and is also the UCOW front-runner winning 20% of all remaining bracket permutations. Many of those on the top 10 list are completely out of it. Just think, without UCOW to stomp on their hopes and dreams they would still think they were in it! That's the sublime beauty of UCOW.
