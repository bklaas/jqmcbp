I hope everyone had as much fun as I did with this year's JQMCBP. Happy to be dishing out the insanity for the 17th time. Now that the tournament is over I can go back to my main passion, serving up 24-hour non-stop country hits. If you enjoyed the candy bar pool, have specific comments or concerns, or ideas to make it better and/or more ridiculous, by all means <a href = "mailto:jqmcbp@gmail.com">send me an email</a>. Seething vitriolic complaints need to go to my customer complaint coordinator, John Niyo.
</p>

<p>If you're finding yourself overwhelmed with good cheer and want to pay it forward, you have two choices: buy yourself your candy bar and have it for lunch (I'm looking at you, Brett "40lbs of Valrhona" Callison), or you can <a href = "http://main.nationalmssociety.org/site/TR/Bike/MNMBikeEvents?px=9224614&pg=personal&fr_id=22278">Donate to my MS-150 bike ride</a>. Just to be clear, JQMCBP is always and forever free, and the JQMCBP isn't a veiled attempt at extracting money from you (though if it were, holy cow what a spectacularly inefficient way of doing that).
</p>
<h1>Burying the Lede: The JQMCBP XVII Champion</h1>
<p>
A hearty congrats go to JQMCBP XVII Champion Meredith "Cadbury Egg" Hammons, who actually cracked everyone else's yolks on Saturday night when Kentucky gut-punched my alma mater Wisconsin in the second semifinal game. With a Kentucky-Connecticut final on the slate for Monday night and Meredith atop the leaderboard with Kenutcky as her champion, there was no way she could lose. But wait, Kentucky DID lose...well, that's because nobody picked Connecticut to win the tournament (this is a JQMCBP first). In fact, nobody picked Connecticut to win the semifinal game either (obviously, another first). Only 6 people had them in the Final Four at all, and a startling 295 (myself among them) had them losing in the <em>first round</em>.
</p>

<p>
Actually, I misspoke. There were some who picked Connecticut to win. By chance, and I mean that in the most literal sense, Connecticut was the 7th most popular choice amongst the 1,000 Chimp Army this year. 20 Chimps, TWENTY, had Connecticut as the champion. Tops amongst this set was Taliyah the Chimp. Taliyah's bracket wasn't quite enough to beat out Meredith, but she did end up in 19th overall place, which I'd hazard a guess is the top finish for a bonobo since the militarization and mobilization of the Grand (plus one) Army. <a href = "http://benklaas.com/jqmcbp/player_bracket.cgi?player_id=10986">If you look at Taliyah's bracket</a>, it's pretty clear she was actually very close to winning the whole thing (Syracuse and Arizona were in her Final Four, but they didn't make it while Connecticut won it all. Go figure).

<p>
So after all of that nonsense about Warren Buffet giving away a Billion Dollars for a perfect bracket (an absolutely brilliant ruse to harvest email addresses for TurboTax advertisements), rest well knowing that 792 of you (again, myself included) were shellacked by at least one <em>totally random coin flip bracket</em> this year; many of you by many more than that (I know you're not going to believe this, but again myself included. In my case 24 chimps beat me). Here are the brave chimps that thought Connecticut had the right stuff to win it all.

<h1>Candy Bar of the Day</h1>
<h2>where I single out one or two of my favorite candy selections</h2>

<p>
Jeff 'with 30min of ESPN knowledge' Hober*,**,***  wins the award for most obscure fictitious candy bar with his selection of Fizzing Whizbees. This is because Fizzing Whizbees are not even the first or second most popular candy in the Harry Potter Universe (the first being jelly beans that sometimes taste like boogers and the second being a chocolate frog that tries to escape being eaten. With candies like those, it's starting to make Jane Jane Tasty Tuna Tidbits look appealing). After researching Jeff's choice, it turns out you can actually buy something called Fizzing Whizbees. According to the Harry Potter Wiki, Fizzing Whizbees are "one of several Harry Potter tie-in sweets that have been manufactured. One reviewer said they are essentially the same as Pop Rocks".
</p>

<p class = 'footnote'>
* Jeff's 30 minutes of ESPN knowledge still had him with Kentucky in the final<br />
** I'm not sure if Jeff has watched ESPN lately, but they aren't actually peddling much in the way of knowledge these days<br />
*** Besides, can you really quantify knowledge in units of time? If so, how many Tiger Woods/Tim Tebow stories do you have to watch to achieve time travel? Wait, what? Yep, time to wrap this JQMCBP thing up for the year.<br />
