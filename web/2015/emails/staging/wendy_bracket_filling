Who's going to win between Duke and Robert Morris? Is Robert Morris just one guy?

Iowa State's a three seed? WAT?

Sorry North Dakota State.


I thought Boise State/Dayton was some weird new school Boise State At Dayton University

Give me one upset in the first round, just give me one. That's all I ask and then I'll leave you alone.
I like Stephen F Austin over Utah
What is Stephen F Austin? Isn't that the three million man?
The three million dollar man? It's six million!
Well, he's no Steve Austin. Wait, is that his name?
Well, there's Stone Cold Steve Austin.
I am never getting these picks done.
I am REALLY tired.
Kind of like Boise State At Dayton U. They are pretty good.

I gotta go with Chinchilla now
Chinchitty
Right, Chinchitty

I'm kind of rooting against Oklahoma State now. Isn't that where that super racist fraternity was?
No, that was Oklahoma.

UhhhhAahhhhhhhhhUhhhhhAhhhhh

Play-in teams are not gonna win.

What do you think of Georgia vs. Michigan State? This is where you start hate being married to me.

Butler vs. Texas. That sounds important. I like that Butler coach. He's like a boy scout.
He's now the coach of the Boston Celtics.
Well. That changes everything.

Northern Iowa??! Northern Iowa?!? Northern Iowa is in this thing? That's like three teams from Iowa.
[silently nods]

What do you think of Kansas WahCheetah? Do you think WahCheetah can knock off Kansas?

You gotta 4 seed going through? Who's your 4 seed. C'mon, gimme a 4 seed.

Don't ask him questions Wendy. He doesn't like it.

I get the candy either way is the thing.

It's unknowable

I don't have any 12 seeds making it to sweet sixteen. Ahhh...it doesn't even matter. Doesn't matter. I watched no minutes of basketball this year. None minutes.

Duke's pretty unstoppable this year, aren't they?
...
You don't care.

Ooooooooklahoma where the wind comes sweepin down the plain

Fred Hoiberg, is he good looking enough to pull this through? That's the question. I'm tired.

I'm taking Wisconsin to the final four. I got to.

I'm just throwing Iowa State a bone here.

Take 5's are pretty good. But I do like Twix. Should I get Take 5 At Twix.

What if I asked for an entire French Silk Pie. Would that be taking it too far?

Reese's Peanut Butter Cups are good but they just go too fast.
