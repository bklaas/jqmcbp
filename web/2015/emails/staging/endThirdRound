Thinkin' Outta the Box

As we were watching the "15 Extra Timeouts Brought to you by Coca-Cola" NCAA games last night, I was thinking that the NCAA needs some new features to keep these games interesting. Here are a couple of ideas:

<p>
* Play-Out Game: Several years ago the NCAA in all of its wisdom decided that 64 teams weren't enough and created these dumb "Play-in" games. Initially the Play-in teams were the 4 worst teams out of the 68, which were teams receiving automatic bids for winning, for example, The Great Rural Nevada Conference tournament. This concept stinks on many levels, most notably (for me) that Play-in games happen too quickly after they are announced to meaningfully include them in an NCAA pool.</p>
<p>So! What if instead of play-in games we have a "Play-out" game, where the worst team gets a bye all the way to the end of the tournament, and gets one shot at defeating for example Kentucky for the NCAA Championship. Sure, they'll get killed, but it would be very exciting to see a Kentucky vs. NNW Scranton College of Obstetrics for ALL THE GLORY.
</p>

<p>Bad idea? Wait, i've got more</p>

<p>* Varied Terrain: I've been logging some big hours with Piper "Popin' Cookin' Happy Sushi House" on Wii U Super Mario Bros, and I've noticed that our adventures are made all the more fun because of the different terrain Mario, Luigi, and Yellow Toad (Piper's favorite) are forced to trek through in order to win the game.</p>

<p>What if NCAA games offered a similar range of terrains:
<ul>
<li>"Oh, you're playing in the West Regional? Good luck, those courts are really sandy! Watch out for the rattlesnakes!"</li> 
<li>"Kentucky is the favorite in this region, but they drew a tough court here in Cleveland, what with the forest on one end and the signature River of Fire to jump over at midcourt."
</li>
<li>"Welcome to the KFC Yum! Center, where the lanes are painted with mashed potatoes and gravy and Popcorn Chicken randomly rains from the sky! Yum!"</li>
</ul>
I think this could be very exciting.
</p>

<p>Still not impressed with my ideas? One more then</p>
<p>*Playing as mascots</p>
<p>
How much more fun would it be if the players on each team had to dress as their respective mascots? For example, the Wisconsin vs. North Carolina game would have featured grown men in Badger suits against a bunch of athletes with the back part of their shoes dipped in pitch (I still would have gone with the badgers here)?
</p>
<p>
I think this is probably the best of my ideas, but I'm concerned that schools would figure out pretty quickly how to game this system. Before long, Nebraska would become a force in basketball after the school controversially changed their name from the cornhuskers to the People Dressed to Play Basketball, only to be thwarted by the freshly renamed Florida A&M Pogo-stick Footed Giants (also watch out for the Air Force Academy Jet Packs).

<p>
Wendy "Take 5" Volkman has reminded me that we have actually witnessed a "game" between people dressed in mascot gear. At the halftime of a real basketball game we were treated to a surreal public service scrimmage from a health care company between a Urine Sample and a Hypodermic Needle. I am not making this up. The Needle won. Turns out it's very hard to dribble (or see) when you are dressed as a cup of pee.
