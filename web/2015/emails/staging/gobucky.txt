Craig "King-Size Kit Kat" Wadz-za-man has parlayed the Power of Kringle into a commanding lead in the JQMCBP with 118 points. One point back is Paul C "Will Have to Buy His Own Baby Ruth" Smith at 117, and then it's a big gap to third place at 108. However, a 16 point pickup for a Duke victory will vault Todd 'Bartman' "Kirby Puckett Bar" Barton into first place. For 1,000 reasons (UW Alumni, Go Bucky, Hate Duke, Enjoy Stenographers, Frank the Tank, Up Yours Duke, etc.) I will be rooting for Wisconsin on Monday, but the acquisition of a 20-year old Kirby Puckett bar gives me a 1,001st reason. GO KRINGLE BOY GO!

I'll admit to not really even thinking that the Final Four might have been happening when planning a family trip to Madison Wisconsin this weekend, but man did that end up being a great place to see the Saturday games. 

The first thing to know driving into Wisconsin is that you don't need any of that Florida-based Gatorade for all of your sports drink needs, but instead pick up a syrupy-sweet Badger Max to mutilate your thirst. It's got electrolytes!

Next, you'll need to gear yourself up for the big game. My initial choice, pin-stripe overalls, were soundly dismissed by my companions with the direct quote "No, Ben. No." Then I found this excellent knit sweater, which I thought was classy but ultimately passed on. I ended up with an XXL fitted hat, a rare find for someone with my King-Size Melon*, but I have to admit I have some remorse for not picking up the best shirt in the house, these three biologically accurate badgers howling at the moon. Next time.

We watched the game at Union South on campus, which allowed us to take part in a bonkers scene with the Badger faithful. Game tip-off was 8pm, and we showed up at 3pm and found out there were no available seats in the big area with the projection screen. We did, however, snag one of the remaining booths in the "auxilliary" area (not to be confused with the auxilliary auxilliary area, which also existed, or the bowling alley). There we camped out and waited for the game to start, FIVE HOURS LATER. Stray observations during the game:

<ul>
<li>Did you know there are now secondary channels broadcasting these games with "Team Stream", which gives you an intentionally stilted broadcast of the game? This is possibly the stupidest TV sports invention I've witnessed in some time. During the Michigan State - Duke game (MSU TeamStream brought to you in SpartyVision), they literally never once showed Duke's Coach K on screen, and showed the Michigan State coach Tom Izzo every 30 seconds throughout the game. Then we got the same thing for the Wisconsin game, giving me more close-ups of Bo Ryan than I'm at all comfortable with. I never saw who was coaching Kentucky, but I think it was Adolph Rupp. I realize TruTV has nothing else to do in the cable graveyard of excessive channels, but honestly this whole concept needs to go.</li>
<li>When you are watching the game with a sea of red-and-white clad fanatics, there is very clearly a conspiracy to JUST HAND KENTUCKY THE CHAMPIONSHIP I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS I DEMAND AN INVESTIGATION.

Nothing to do with the actual game, but The University of Wisconsin Memorial Union Rathskeller has the greatest mural in the history of murals, <a href = "https://www.flickr.com/photos/35137853@N00/16844638588/">the Tragic Battle of Beer v.
