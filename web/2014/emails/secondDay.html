I had the good fortune to take in the Iowa State - NC Sentra Legals game last night with my dad at an area watering hole. ISU looked really good, though losing one of their best players to a broken foot will probably reduce the chances of my ISU-Creighton finals match up (it was always far-fetched, but I was trying to do right by the great state of Iowa this year). 
</p>
<p>
Anyway, Dad and I got home close to midnight and I made the unprecedented move to go right to sleep instead of waiting for the Tulsa-UCLA game to finish (West Coast, I shake my fist at your timezone). I'm sure at least 4 or 5 of the 810 humans in this year's pool (all-time JQMCBP record, by the way) were just sitting there at 2am CDT hitting refresh-refresh-refresh wondering why the leaderboard wasn't updating*, and worse yet wondering WHERE IS MY RAMBLING CANDYMEISTER EMAIL?. Well, in the advanced age of my XVIIth year of JQMCBP, I was in deep need of shuttin' er down for the night. A solid choice, as I have awoken once again with the ability to write long, comma-filled, parenthetical heavy (or footnoted*****) sentences once again.
</p>

<p>
* While I'll do my best to update via smartphone, get ready for more leaderboard delays, I'm going to a community theater production of The Sound of Music** this afternoon.<br />
** I know, right? Save me, my entire family is in it***<br />
*** They love musicals****<br />
**** I do not.<br />

<h1>Upsets...who picked 'em</h1>
<h2>Highlighting those brave souls that chose oddball longshots to win games</h2>

<p>
The day started out with a bang with Duke exiting at the hands of Mercer (who both looked great and apparently had some guy on the team <a href = "http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2014/03/21/duke_mercer_upset_dance_from_kevin_canevari_a_primer_on_the_nae_nae.html">dancing something called the NaeNae</a>). Only 15 people picked Duke, including Brian Stromquist who used <a href ="http://exygy.com/generating-a-smart-ncaa-bracket/">this javascript method</a> and <a href = "https://www.codersbracket.com/code_bracket">this coder's bracket generator tool</a> to generate a bracket based on weighted probabilities given by Nate Silver's published model (though notable: Silver's Mercer win probability was listed at 7%; sometimes you roll weighted dice and they still come up with the unexpected). 
</p>

<p>
Also picking Duke to lose were Blair 'Beefcake' Brownyard who, as mentioned in the last update, made all of his picks based on mascot toughness. Also picking the Mercer win was at least one child under 10. Also picking a Duke loss was someone named "Candy Chatawanich". Also that candy-hating Wilbur Wonka, DDS. So...yeah.
</p>

<p>
Nothing else really ranked to high on the JQMCBP upset meter. 186 people had Stephen F Austin winning, which one in spectacular fashion with a little help from a questionable 4-point play at the end of regulation.
</p>

<div class = 'pre'>

<h1>Shout Outs</h1>
<h2>where I pseudo-randomly (by which I mean not randomly at all) give a shout out to one or many of you, my loyal pool contestants.</h2>

<p>
Pool veteran Brian "Data Smasher" Hutchinson has informed me that his IT guy is Kip Winger's cousin Scott. Kip's deeply disturbing 80s song "Seventeen" was the featured XVII link at the top of my first email. I love these Brushes with (Semi-)Greatness or Relatives of (Semi-)Greatness stories, and will be looking forward to hearing more*.
</p>

<p>
* I actually have one for today. I once served coffee to a deeply inebriated Stevie Nicks at the Village Inn Pancake House in Ames, Iowa** in 1988.<br />
** Go Cyclones!

<h1>Mailbag</h1>

<p>
The mailbag was hopping Friday...so many to choose from. I've decided to highlight emails from two of my nieces, Ellie Chungath and Rowan Klaas, who have a mastery of email emojis and color selections that far dwarfs my own. 
</p>
	<ul>
		<li> <a href = "http://benklaas.com/jqmcbp/images/ellie1.png">Ellie on Emojis</a></li>
		<li> <a href = "http://benklaas.com/jqmcbp/images/ellie2.png">Ellie on Emojis Part Deux</a></li>
		<li> <a href = "http://benklaas.com/jqmcbp/images/rowan.png">Rowan's Spectacular Color Palette</a></li>
	</ul>

<p>
In case you were wondering, I did grant Rowan special niece power and allowed her candy choice of "1 lb chocolate bunny" to be replaced with "Anything the size of my head".

<h1>Whose champion bit it?</h1>
<h2>Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose, but it never sucks worse than when the team you picked to win it all loses it all. It's even worse when I publish it for all to read!</h2>

<p>
Luke, your pick of Coastal Carolina to win it all has to be the most painful of the 28 that lost their champion yesterday. In what seemed like a prescient selection, now you just look a wee bit foolish. No matter, the Chanticleers (a <a href = "http://grfx.cstv.com/schools/coas/graphics/chauncey-fb.jpg">crafty, quick-witted rooster</a>) will rise again.

<h1>Boo Rah Rah</h1>
<h2>I asked you if your alma mater was in the tournament. Why? So I could make fun of you when they lose!</h2>

<p>
Okay MaKenzie Margaret Smalling, how is that degree from California Polytechnic of San Luis Obispo treating you? Pool participants, you are being duped. MaKenzie is not a graduate of Cal Poly SLO, or if she is she would be easily its youngest graduate, as she is not even 10 years old. Apparently this kind of academic fraud is rampant in JQMCBP this year amongst pre-10s (pre-10 is the new pre-teen), as evidenced by this shocking whistleblower email I received from Patty "Inventor of the Modern J Factor Statistic" Henshaw.
</p>

<div class = 'mailbag'>
Ben,
Considering that I work with Chris Long (and introduced him to the JQMCBP), I feel like I am eminently qualified to report that Gavin Long, who is 10(ish) and not Doogie Howser, is definitely not a North Carolina State alum. Even if Gavin entered that himself for some reason*, I hate to see him tarred for the sins of his father. (You'll notice that Chris missed a perfect Day 1 by only his misplaced loyalty to the Wolfpack.**)

Guess I better go check and make sure Pat didn't sign Katie up as an Iowa State alumna on her inaugural bracket...which, by the way, I think is a pretty credible effort for a 6-year old who knows nothing about college basketball.
Patty

* Brainwashing? Or maybe just excessive exposure to NC State alumni--we are in Seattle and thus subject to the cult of Russell "Pack of Badgers" Wilson***
** Even if they really should have won that game...
*** Use of JQMCBP-style footnotes is totally an homage...and possibly a shameless ploy for the mailbag.
</div>

<p>
Just a reminder though Patty, nobody likes a snitch.
</p>

<p>
Here's the roll call of people that lost their (possibly fictional) alma mater Friday.
</p>
<div class = 'pre'>
Cal Poly SLO: MaKenzie Margaret Smalling, Jeremy Farr

Duke: Jeb Byers, Connor Byers, Tim Hoelscher, wilson korol, Kirk Moloney, Kurt Evan Anderson

Kansas State: Bill Rogers

New Mexico: David Mitchell

<h1>Candy Bar of the Day</h1>
<h2>where I single out one or two of my favorite candy selections</h2>

<p>
Greg Wenz has lived in Thailand, and understands the horrors of desserts from Southeast Asia. To paraphrase Greg "Fermented beans are not treats!" This does not appear to have affected Greg's decision for Popin' Cookin' Sushi Kit (yes, that's how you spell it). You may wonder what Popin' Cookin' Sushi Kit is, and how it qualifies as "candy". Well, <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiJbgYwlxWc">this handy and informative instructional video</a> teaches you all you need to know*.

<h1>Enough with the crap, who's ahead?</h1>

<p>Congrats to Georgia's own Amish Das, standing atop the leadboard alone after round 1. Lurking right behind Amish are 9 more, including THE Kai Anderson, Rod "Big Hunk" Harl, and Gene "Danger Zone" Seichter. I have also been reminded* that my 8-year-old daughter Piper is leading my household's competition.
