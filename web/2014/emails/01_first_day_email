Welcome to JQMCBP XVI! Good to be back again, burning the midnight oil to bring you the most important email you'll receive all Friday morning between midnight and 2am.

Firstly, quite literally, I am the proud father of Carson Moxie Klaas, who sits on top of the heap in 1st place after the first sixteen games, tied with ALL CAPS JACOB BENSON of Colorado. I let her know right before bedtime that she was tied for 1st place (and this was before her prophetic Harvard pick rolled in late, shedding most of those she was tied with). She was so excited she let out a girlish scream (more on girlish screams in the mailbag below). JQMCBP history shows that the first day rabbits usually fall back to the pack as the tournament progresses, but for now she's top of the class. And kudos to you too JACOB BENSON, but DO STOP SHOUTING I CAN TOTALLY HEAR YOU.

My whole family entered this year, and when I was reading the bracket to my other daughter Piper I was giving her the mascots for each team. Since I've been doing this tournament for an eternity I've memorized most of these (though ousted already, love those Akron Zips). But when I came to Belmont I was stuck so I just said with a chuckle "The Belmont Stakes". This went over 1st grader Piper's head, but as she is wont to do she took it in a different direction and started calling all of the teams "Steaks". Kansas Steaks, North Carolina Steaks, etc. So anyway, I end up looking up the Belmont mascot and it's the Bruins. Which of course makes total sense because Belmont is in Nashville, and that city is just crawling with bears.

For the rookies:
What I do is send out email updates (personalized just for your entry!) several times during the course of the tournament. I go on and on and on over seemingly meaningless minutia. It might seem meaningless but...well okay, it's meaningless. But we'll have fun, or your money back.*

In addition to the emails, there's lots of important, vital resources available with your web browser. Check out the links at the bottom of the email or head to http://benklaas.com/jqmcbp/leaderboard.cgi as a jumping off point.

* Refund applications need to be filed in triplicate and mailed to the Johnny Quest Memorial Candy Bar Pool Customer Service Department, care of its Parent Corporation, Slaptronics Personal Massage Therapy and Self Help Video Distribution Corporation of Netherland Antilles (nasdaq:SPMTSHVDCNA). Or you could contact your congressperson, which will give you a similar outcome.

One technical item of business: I've spent years and years rejiggering my home brew email program to get around the myriad spam filters, and this year has proven to finally hit the breaking point where I think more than half of my emails are going directly to people's spam folder. So, I talked to my old pal Lucky the Chimp, who is a seasoned expert in the sending of bulk email. Lucky doesn't call it spam but instead "targeted tomfoolery". Regardless, Lucky's service of choice is, I might have guessed it, MailChimp (I am not making this up). So I'm giving a shot at sending this year's emails through the MailChimp service in hopes of hitting more inboxes and less junk folders.

Because of using MailChimp the links you see in the email will be long and ugly but they will correclty redirect to where I'm pointing you. Scouts honor, no shenanigans!

ALSO, even worse, MailChimp will not allow me to send multiple emails to the same address. So if you signed up several brackets on one email address, you will not be getting a personalized email for each entry, just one. How about we call this a "feature" and call an end to the tech talk.

Now let's get on with it!

Upsets...who picked 'em -- 

Oh Harvard Crimson, why did you pick this year to win your first NCAA game ever? My own bracket, which I'd now burn if it wasn't electronic, had New Mexico all the way to the final game. Oh well, I will live vicariously through Carson (#1! #1!), who was amongst the 41 that nailed this pick.

Harvard:  Amy Hewis, Artie Wilkowsky, bj6395, Carson Moxie Klaas, Christy Reed, Cousin Jones, DHoops, Dr. Wilbur Wonka, Edziu, Elizabeth Short, Gage Teer, Gregory (GJWII), Jane Kehrwald, Janine Klaas, Jared Elfvin, Jason, Jon Blake, Josh Foster, Julie Wendell, Kevin Nolan, Kona Anders, Kurt Anderson, Liana Hilgenkamp, Linda Britton, Lisa Blake, Maria Blake, Mazzie Cakes, Meg Whelan, Michael Ferreter, Mrs. Mitchell Goosen, Patrick Connolly, Rowan Elisabeth Klaas, Sara Van Houten, Scott Mortimer, Sparty Party, Sue Ray, Susie Smalling, Tanya Ramos, Teresa Dixon, Tina Ferreter, Traci Nies, Trey (GJWIII)

Shout Outs 
where I pseudo-randomly (by which I mean not randomly at all) give a shout out to one or many of you, my loyal pool contestants.

I'm going to open this section with a first in JQMCBP email shout out history: I'm going to shout out to a specific filter in the JQMCBP Filtermatic(TM) (http://benklaas.com/jqmcbp/filtermatic.cgi). For those new to this exciting* tool, you can create filters so you can view the leaderboard with just a subset of players. Typically this is done so people that know each other can have a little on-the-side competition away from The Quest for Candy(TM). But this filter, 'The Nicknames List', authored by persons unknown, attempts to get together everyone that entered some kind of nickname for themselves. It's an amusing list, currently with 'Never too fresh' Soren Van Houten beating the other nomes de plume**.

* generally not that exciting
** yeah, that's right. nomes de plume.

Yay! Girlish scream! The event of the year, the highlight of my drab, lonely, pathetic existence....the JQMCBP!

I start and end each day with a girlish scream. True story.

Send me funny things! I just might print them! When you get published in a JQMCBP email, experts* have determined** that this kind of exposure is 10x more effective for fame*** and fortune**** than either Facebook or Twitter*****.

*** not so much
**** candy!

Whose champion bit it? -- 

Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose, but it never sucks worse than when the team you picked to win it all loses it all. It's even worse when I publish it for all to read!

Last year after day 1 there was exactly one player that lost their champion. This year was a little more painful, with 12 of you going down in flames. But seriously Meg, Valparaiso?

New Mexico: kai anderson, John 'Sweet Tart' Flaa, Kelly 'Huh?' Clark, ELRONDO, Alex Cory, Michelle A Mondoux, David Mitchell, Piper Dare Klaas, Aaron Cox
Oklahoma State: Joe Highbarger
UNLV: Dave Giugni
Valparaiso: Meg Whelan

----------------------
Boo Rah Rah --

I asked you if your alma mater was in the tournament. Why? So I could make fun of you when they lose!

Looking back on last year, Davidson, Montana and New Mexico State were all first day losers in 2012 as well. But I probably don't have to remind those that matriculated from these fine institutions that.

Akron: Doug Gilbert, Mike Shanahan, Dustin Thonen
Bucknell: Scott Chesky
Davidson: Ken Howard, Glenn Caldera, Meredith Caldera
Missouri: Brian Joseph
Montana: Suebob Robinson, william cooper
New Mexico: Danny Jarrett, David Mitchell
New Mexico State: kim coffey, David 'Crusher' Lucas, Julie 'Mother of Little Crusher' Smith, Fatty Stinky
Oklahoma State: jeffrey mckeage, chris breese
Pittsburgh: Jim Parker, Tim Hoffman, williford

Fun With Data -- 

For the third time in JQMCBP history we topped 700 entries, though at 711 we just fell short of the record 722 from 2008.
http://benklaas.com/jqmcbp/graphs/entries_yeartoyear.png

I'm not worried about zero growth since 2008. Ian Faith, manager of Spinal Tap, understands this concept well.

Marty: The last time Tap toured America, they where, uh, booked into 10,000 seat arenas, and 15,000 seat venues, and it seems that now, on their current tour they're being booked into 1,200 seat arenas, 1,500 seat arenas, and uh I was just wondering, does this mean uh...the popularity of the group is waning?
Ian: Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no...no, no, not at all. I, I, I just think that the.. uh.. their appeal is becoming more selective.

----------------------
Candy Bar of the Day --
where I single out one or two of my favorite candy selections

As I've done since his brackets became available publicly a few years ago, I've entered President Barack Obama's bracket in the pool (he is currently tied for 528th place). His candy selection of "The One Usher Stole from Me" has some delicious backstory.

http://newsroom.mtv.com/2009/01/19/usher-recalls-stealing-barack-obamas-candy-bar/

 "We had been campaigning all day, all over the place, and I kind of look around and I'm like, 'Oooh, let me eat this candy bar or whatever,' " Usher remembered. "And we both look at it, and I'm like, 'You're not gonna eat that, are you?' and he's like, 'You're not gonna eat it, are you?' I'm like, 'Well, I'm gonna eat it if you don't.' "


And I'm like, 'Usher, why are you like talking like you are a teenager?' and he's like 'Shut up I'm Usher'
