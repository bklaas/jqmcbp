After 14 great years as Candymeister over the world's largest completely free, completely advertisement and marketing free, completely insane Candy Bar Pool, I have decided to call it quits. I realized about mid-week that selection Sunday was less than a week a way, and I was not only unprepared, but also uninspired. We here at JQMCBP Headquarters know you, my faithful entrants, deserve more than that. So rather than give you a watered down product, I have decided to give you...(wait for it...)

	<span class = 'announcement'>It's been three long years since the last JQMCBP, and it's time. Time to dust off the brackets. Time to re-re-research obscure candybars. Time to talk smack. Time to activate and mobilize the 1000 Chimp Army. IT'S TIME.
<p></p>See you March 11.
