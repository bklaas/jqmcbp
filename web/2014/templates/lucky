<h1>Lucky the Chimp</h1>


<p>To introduce newcomers to the JQMCBP, Lucky the Chimp is our loyal mascot and favorite repeat offender (see above). He's back again with his random coin-flip-generated bracket, and he's again brought his <a href = "?army">POSSE.</a></p>

<p>Lucky had a dream run in 2001, picking Duke to win it all (which they did). Although his other picks didn't do so well, he still beat a huge number of entrants.</p>

<p>Lucky is the leader of the <a href = "?army">1000 CHIMP ARMY</a> again, in an effort to redeem his years of futile efforts.</p>
