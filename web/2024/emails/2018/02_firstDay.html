(tap, tap, tap) Is this on? Check, 1...2...3...Oh my, are we doing this thing again?? <a href = "https://youtu.be/dF9OLZKSC5k">Well okay then.</a> Aaaaaand we're off, like a herd of turtles, into this, the Twenty First Johnny Quest Memorial Candy Bar Pool (JQMCBP XXI).
835 humans* have entered with dreams of sweet, sweet candy. Good luck to you all, as statistically each of you have very little chance of winning!
</p>

<p>
For the rookies:
What I do is send out email updates (personalized just for your entry!) several times during the course of the tournament. I go on and on and on over seemingly meaningless minutia. It might seem meaningless but...well okay, it's meaningless. But we'll have fun, or your money back.**
</p>

<p>
In addition to the emails, there's lots of important, vital resources available with your web browser. Evaluate how risky your picks are with the <a href = "https://benklaas.com/jqmcbp/whatsyourj.cgi">J Factor</a>, see who picked brackets like yours with the <a href = "https://benklaas.com/jqmcbp/sss.cgi">Scientific Similarity Index</a>. As the tournament progresses, figure out who has no chance of winning at the <a href = "https://benklaas.com/jqmcbp/hallofshame.cgi">Hall of Shame!</a> Generate pointless <a href = "https://benklaas.com/jqmcbp/hallofshame.cgi">head-to-head graphs</a>! Every one of my emails will contain these linky links at the bottom of the email or head to <a href = "http://benklaas.com/jqmcbp/leaderboard.cgi">The Leaderboard</a> as a jumping off point.
</p>

<p>
As I've done for the past few years, I'm sending emails through the appropriately named <a href = "http://mailchimp.com">MailChimp</a> mass email service. This is Lucky the Chimp's favorite email service, and because it actually sends emails that people tend to receive. However, MailChimp will not allow me to send multiple emails to the same email address. So, if you signed up several brackets on one email address, you only be getting one personalized email for each entry. How about we call this a "feature" and call an end to the tech talk.
</p>

<p>
* Plus 1,001 chimps. This number has been remarkably steady.
</p>

<p>
** Refund applications need to be filed in triplicate and mailed to the Johnny Quest Memorial Candy Bar Pool Customer Service Department, care of its Parent Corporation, Slaptronics Personal Massage Therapy and Self Help Video Distribution Corporation of Netherland Antilles (nasdaq:SPMTSHVDCNA). Or you could contact your congressperson, which will give you a similar outcome.

<p>
But enough of my yakkin'. Let's boogie!

<h1>Losing Mascots: Let's Talk About Them!</h1>
<h2>Pointless Discussion about Losing Teams and Their Mascots</h2>

<p>
Apparently the <a href = "http://www.radford.edu/content/radfordcore/home/news/releases/2018/march/Highlander-top-mascot-2018-NCAA-Tournament.html">Radford Highlanders</a> have been rated the top mascot in the NCAA Tournament. 
</p>

<p>
Charles Curtis of USA Today Sports wrote. “Between the beard, the costume, the muscles, the headband and all the "<a href = "https://youtu.be/sqcLjcSloXs">THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE!!!</a>".
</p>
<p>
I dunno...I'm a fan of the epic motion picture Highlander, but can the ONE be Radford University? Clearly not in this tournament, as they were eliminated.
</p>

<p>
I'd also like to talk about the Buffalo Bulls. C'mon Buffalo, this is a golden opportunity lost. If I was Buffalo University, I'd name my mascot the Buffalo. The Buffalo Buffalo would be epic. The crowd would shout "BUFFALOFUFFALOBUFFALOBUFFALO" and before long opponents would be so disoriented they would not know which Buffalo was up. Opponents like, perhaps, Arizona University. But more on that in the next section.
</p>

<p>
Probably the worst mascot comes from Penn University. The Quakers? They named their mascot after a religious group that has historically been conscientious objectors to war and came up with an idea called, and I am not making this up, <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quakers#Quietism">Quietism</a>. Don't get me wrong, this all sounds like a noble and thoughtful faith, but can you imagine the Quaker sports announcer?
</p>
<p>
"Ladies and Gentlemen! Let's all put our hands at our sides and give a warm but SILENT welcome to YOUR! PENN! QUAKERS!"
</p>
<p>
And the crowd goes orderly and contemplative.

<p>
Oh, Arizona, how we hardly knew ye (aside from <a href = "https://www.si.com/nba/2018/02/23/sean-miller-arizona-basketball-scandal-deandre-ayton">utterly massive scandals</a>). The Buffalo...ahem, Bulls, were big winners over the much higher seeded Arizona Wildkitties. Only 48 brave humans prognosticated this event, and here they are:

<h1>Mailbag</h1>

<p>
Lots of emails yesterday and today as people were getting their picks in. I even spoke <i>ein bischen Deutsch</i> tech support (mostly cursing, which is what I know) with someone in <i>Die Schweiz</i>. However, my mail of the day comes from Peter Kroha, who gave the most succinct and self-deprecating plea for leniency on a late entry:
</p>
<div class = 'quote'>
I have been in the Johnny Quest for over 15 years and I suck and I am a Procrastinator.
</div>

<p>
You have?<br />You do.<br />And you are!*
</p>
<p>* I let Peter in after the games started. The late start clearly gave him a competitive advantage, as he currently sits in 750th place.
</p>

<hr class = 'subsection' />
<p>
<a href = "mailto:jqmcbp@gmail.com">Send me funny things</a>! I just might print them! When you get published in a JQMCBP email, experts* have determined** that this kind of exposure is 10x more effective for fame*** and fortune**** than either Snapchat or Instagram*****.
</p>

Amongst the vanquished, pool super-vets THE Kai Anderson and John "totally doesn't know sportsball" Niyo.

Also out is Denis B Charette because of Penn's loss. Asked about the loss, Denis replied with an utterly outrageous slight nod and almost audible intake of breath.

<p>
11 of you saw your alma maters go down on Thursday. Not too many, but I expect that number to climb today, as Lipscomb and Maryland Baltimore County are hitting the hardwood.

Parusing the list, I noticed friend and co-worker Josiah James Grover's selection. Sour Liquid Candy Urine Samples. That can't be a thing. There's no way that's a thing.

<a href = "https://youtu.be/ua3mbE7iTqA">Oh, it's a thing.</a>

<h2>Top 10 Humans</h2>
<p>
Nobody made it through the first day clean, but we do have 7 Humans and 0 Chimps leading the charge at 15 out of 16 correctly prognosticated.

<p>
My daughters Carson Moxie and Piper Dare are both right behind the leaders with 14 points. Does this make me feel better as I languish in 769th place? No, no it does not.

<h2>Top 10 Chimps</h2>
Fabiola and Cecilia the Chimp lead all other Chimps with 14 points. They both have the Buffalo Buffalo as their champ, so if somehow Buffalo wins their next five games it will truly be Year of the Chimp. And Buffalo.
