            <h1>Fun Facts About Farleigh Dickinson</h1>
<p>
For the second time in tournament history (the first being the Maryland-Baltimore County Retriever's victory over Virginia in 2018), a #16 seed has upset at #1 seed. Going into Farleigh Dickinson's game versus Purdue, the collective record of #16 seeds in the tournament was 1-151. Well, now it's 2-151. Upsets like this leave us with questions, most notably, what is a Farleigh Dickinson? How did they get here? How did I get here? Rest assured, I am here for you with all the answers.
</p>

<p>
<b>What is a Farleigh Dickinson?</b>
</p>
<p>
Farleigh Dickinson is a rare condition that makes one's left leg, and only the left leg, involuntarily kick Rockettes-style in times of stress. If you suffer from Farleigh Dickinson Syndrome, the good news is that help is on the way. Kixatrex, a new medication proven to be effective* in the treatment of Farleigh Dickinson, can help you stop kicking your left leg in stressful situations.
</p>

<p>
* In 86% of patients, Kixatrex may cause the following side effects: sleeplessness, drowsiness, loss of appetite, incredible appetite, feelings of inner peace, excessive shouting, periodic but predictable ability to communicate with inanimate objects, spontaneous extra limb regeneration, and in rare cases perfectly moisturized skin. Ask your doctor is Kixatrex is right for you.
</p>

<p>
<b>But seriously, let's talk about Farleigh Dickinson</b>
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Farleigh Dickinson had to play Texas Southern in a play-in game to make it into the 64-team field. Texas Southern's record was 14-20, yet <em>were considered the favorites in the game.</em></li>
<li>Farleigh Dickinson's automatic berth in the tournament was not because they won their conference. The automatic berth <em>defaulted</em> to them because the conference champs, Merrimack, were not eligible as they haven't been in Division 1 long enough yet to qualify.</li>
<li>Farleigh Dickinson lost to the following teams this year:</li>
<ul>
    <li>Southern Illinois-Edwardsville</li>
    <li>Longwood</li>
    <li>Stonehill</li>
    <li>Hartford</li>
    <li>Queens College</li>
    <li>Central Connecticut</li>
    <li>Sacred Heart (twice)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Farleigh Dickinson is the shortest team in NCAA Division 1 basketball.</li>
<li>Farleigh Dickinson beat Purdue, who have a 7'4" center.</li>
<li>Farleigh Dickinson's head coach is an alum of Interstate 35 High School, which apart from being hilariously named, is also a school I know well. I once competed in Speech Club (known in pretty much the rest of the known universe as Forensics) at I-35 H.S. in Truro, Iowa. My performance was in the Comedic Acting section (what'd you expect, drama?), which didn't get rolling until mid-afternoon. I came down on a bus with all the other speech club nerds, including long-time JQMCBP entrant Joshua "Phil" Littrell. Josh I think was also in comedic acting? I mean, he's basically always comedic acting; ask his kids about how he dresses up in a turkey suit just to jump scare them when they wake up. But I digress.  The two of us had the whole day to burn, and we chose to leave I-35 H.S. and wander the mean streets of Truro. We discovered Truro is basically the real-life representation of the song <a href = "https://youtu.be/qOfkpu6749w">Pink Houses</a>. I-35's team is aptly called the Roadrunners. Where am I going with this? Do I have to be going somewhere with this? I don't. I'm the Meister, and this is my party. Anyway, the Farleigh Dickinson coach is from there.

			<h1>Losing Mascots: Let's Talk About Them!</h1>
			<h2>Pointless Discussion about Losing Teams and Their Mascots</h2>

			<p>
Woof, there is so much to talk about today. Speaking of woof, let's start with the Bulldogs.
			</p>

<p>
There were two Bulldog teams vanquished Friday. <b>Who wore it better?</b>
</p>

<p>
First we have the University of North Carolina - Asheville Bulldogs.
</p>

<p>
<img src = "https://mcusercontent.com/b94193d8d716ab819d32fb668/images/2afa82b4-9a27-9949-9124-0e94494568e6.png" width = "90%" />
</p>

<p>
Why is this bulldog's jaw in a fixed agape fashion? Is it okay? Did it take too much Kixatrex? Surely this can't be the winner. 
</p>

<p>
Next we have the Drake Bulldogs.
</p>
<p>
<img src = "https://mcusercontent.com/b94193d8d716ab819d32fb668/images/3033f803-174c-60b8-b2c5-448b66f5ca28.jpg" width = 50%" />
</p>
<p>
AAAAAAAAAAH WHAT IS EVEN HAPPENING HERE? This is hands-down the weirdest looking bulldog I've ever seen. It looks like someone started out trying to make a sockpuppet monkey and ended up with something so wrong they just shrug-emojied and called it a bulldog.
</p>

<p>
And the WINNER is...the 1970s era Drake Bulldog of my youth. BRING BACK CLASSIC DRAKE BULLDOG!
</p>

<p>
<img src = "https://mcusercontent.com/b94193d8d716ab819d32fb668/images/c3830126-4030-72a7-df16-8bb222f3089c.jpg" width = "50%" />
</p>

<p>The 2023 tournament also sports two Gaels, but we can't play Losing Mascot Who Wore it Better because Saint Mary's did manage to win their game. Nevertheless, I'd like to put the spotlight on the Iona Gaels as potentially the most terrifying mascot this year. Just look at this guy! Would you bring your 6-year old up for a photo? ONLY IF YOU WANT YOUR KID'S DREAMS FOREVER HAUNTED!
</p>
<p>
<img src = "https://mcusercontent.com/b94193d8d716ab819d32fb668/images/ef7a8218-6138-e94e-141b-10105189b531.jpg" width = "90%" />
</p>

<p>FOREVER. HAUNTED.</p>
<p>
<img src = "https://mcusercontent.com/b94193d8d716ab819d32fb668/images/aa9860a9-adeb-46e2-ba9d-158c8d1e7653.jpg" width = "90%" />
</p>

<p>
Also lost in the first round: a Boilermaker, an Owl, a Catamount, a Gaucho, a Ram, a Cardinal (which represents a Cyclone, which also could not help its team score more than 41 points, C'MON), a Friar, an Antelope, a Sun Devil, and a Golden Flash.
<p>

</p>
			<hr class='section' />
			<h1>Upsets...who picked 'em</h1>
			<h2>Highlighting those brave souls that chose oddball longshots to win games</h2>

<p>
15 people had Farleigh Dickinson over Purdue in round 1, including someone named "coinflip", repeat last place finisher Andrew Mossburg, Nathan Conkling, Aidan Conkling AND Aidan Conkling (what are the odds of two different people named Aidan Conkling both entering JQMCBP, and BOTH picking Farleigh Dickinson? Amazing).

			<h1>Whose champion bit it?</h1>
			<h2>Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose, but it never sucks worse than when the team you picked to win it all loses it all. It's even worse when I publish it for all to read!</h2>

<p>
126 of you, about 16% of the whole field, lost their champ on Day 2. The great majority of those had Purdue picked. Boilermaker? More like Boilerbreaker, amirite? Sucks to be you!

<p>So long suckers!</p>

			<hr class='section' />
			<h1>Boo Rah Rah</h1>
			<h2>I asked you if your alma mater was in the tournament. Why? So I could make fun of you when they lose!
			</h2>

<p>
JQMCBP was first created on the campus of The Iowa State University of Science and Technology while I was in grad school, so it does follow that ISU's loss hits the JQMCBP community hard. 41 points! That's all they scored! Gadzooks!
</p>
<p>
I also was briefly a Ph.D. student at UC-Santa Barbara, who did put up a bit of a fight before losing their game as well. Good to see plenty of Gauchos in the field. 
</p>
<p>
Since Wisconsin (The Meister's undergrad institution) didn't even make the field, the lone school I have left where I hold college credit is...checks notes...Missouri? I have ONE credit from the University of Missouri, from the summer of 1992 when I was mist netting songbirds in the Ozarks. True story. I'll get you a transcript. I passed.

			<h2>Top 10 Humans</h2>

			<p>
We have 5-way tie at the top with 27 points. That's right, even the best of the best still missed 5 of the first 32 picks. Greg "Kinder Bueno" Miller and Owen "take 5" MacDonell share the lead with the Triple-K threat of Katie, Katy, and Kerie, all of Michigan. Interestingly, these five all have different champs (including Owen's pick of Purdue, so don't get used to the air up here Owen). It's a wide open race for The Candy.
