I hope you all had a great time with this year's JQMCBP. JQMCP is forever free, but if you are feeling an urge to shower me with gifts, I ride 150 miles on my bicycle in June to raise money for Multiple Sclerosis research. <a href ="http://bit.ly/bkMS150_2016">Donate to my ride here</a>. Now let's get to Whahappened!
</p>

<hr class = 'section' />
<h1>Whahappened?</h1>
<h2>
Congratulations to Julia "GUMMY BEARS" Foster, the JQMCBP XIX CHAMPION!
</h2>
<p>If you recall, a few emails ago I was trumpeting the dominance of one 11-year-old Kiera Delargy, leading the field of Candy Seekers for several rounds in a row. This was a great accomplishment, and Julia should be proud. But alas, in the end, Kiera was JUST. TOO. OLD.
</p>
<p>Out of the woodwork, with a special hunch about Villanova going all the way, comes Julia "I'm 10, and I'm better than all 756* of the rest of you" Foster. Julia has earned the coveted Gummy Bears prize with 112 points, outpacing the entire field by 5 or more points. <b>Fosters: send me your address and I'll send Julia some Gummy Bears.</b>
</p>

<p>
* +1000 Chimps
</p>

<p>
Second place, winning the traditional prize of BIG FAT NOTHING, is a tie between Brenda VB and Bill Girardot. Congrats! I do not need your address!
<p>

<p>
While the game was being played Monday, I'd sort of forgotten that Hawaii Standard Time is 5 hours behind what I'm used to. I was walking down the street in Historic Kapaa Town in the late afternoon, specifically <a href = "https://www.google.com/maps/@22.0764826,-159.3178726,3a,75y,326.75h,84.92t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s2FyeejVpg-U5yF0JHi436g!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1">right outside this sports bar with wide open-air windows</a>, and spied through the TVs over the bar that there were 14.5 seconds left and North Carolina was down 3. Then UNC hit <a href = "http://deadspin.com/marcus-paiges-shot-deserved-better-1769096319">this ridiculous shot</a> to tie up the game with 4 seconds left. Villanova calls a time out, and I continue to loiter. Then they hit a buzzer-beater to win the thing.
</p>
<p>
After much whooping and hollering by myself and the 4-6 other people paying attention in Historic Kapaa Town*, I proceeded down the road and announced loudly to several people with heads buried in smartphones that Villanova had pulled it out (I was right, they were all checking scores). One of the more fun endings to an NCAA championship game, and in case you missed it check out 
<a href = "http://screengrabber.deadspin.com/heres-every-angle-and-every-call-of-villanovas-ncaa-tou-1769055349">this tremendously entertaining set of every angle and every call of the buzzer-beating Villanova shot.</a> My favorites are the Canal+ Spanish announcer Antonio Lamolda "Siiiiiiiiiiiiiiii! Viya-Nova!", the Villanova IMG announcer Ryan Fannon "CATS WIN! CATS WIN! CATS WIN!", as well as the contrasting <a href = "https://twitter.com/NBAonTNT/status/717229145051291648?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">Charles Barkley / Kenny "the Jet" Smith</a> reactions.

<p>
Also of special note: this year Nyla the Chimp, with an extra-orbital J-Factor of 46.75, finished in an astonishing <i>11th Place</i> overall. In the modern JQMCBP era, aka when I finally started recording scores directly in the database, this is the best finish ever by a chimp. Here are the Top Chimps and their ranks since 2006:
<p>

<ul>
	<li>2006: Iliana the Chimp: 17th*</li>
	<li>2007: Ryann the Chimp: 391st</li>
	<li>2008: Joe the Chimp: 269th</li>
	<li>2009: Shayna the Chimp: 338th</li>
	<li>2010-2011: JQMCBP Lockout due to Stolen Meister Mojo</li>
	<li>2012: Gianna the Chimp: 216th</li>
	<li>2013: Robin the Chimp: 178th</li>
	<li>2014: Taliyah the Chimp: 19th**</li>
	<li>2015: Terrell the Chimp: 201st</li>
	<li>2016: Nyla the Chimp: <b>11th</b></li>
</ul>

<p>
* 2006 was the "George Mason in the final four" year<br />
** 2014 was the "7th seed Connecticut wins it all" year
</p>

<p>p.s. this also means that a coin-flipping chimp beat 98.5% of all humans. GOOD JOB WITH THE EVOLUTION, HUMAN RACE.

<p>
Here are 14, or 1.8%, of the JQMCBP pool of humans that picked Villanova to win it all. They were a #2 seed, same as Michigan State, of whom 35.5% of you picked to go all the way. So, yeah, good job.

I THINK my kid just won what we lovingly refer to as the "monkey bracket"???  Julia Foster is 10 and if she did win, we are all going to fall off our chairs laughing!  If you're worried she had help, check out the LucasFamily and Friends filter for her potential helpers.  Monkeys wouldn't ask us for help picking their noses!

Editor's note: Luckicious J. Chimp was reached at his Rancho Cucamunga Banana Farm, Spa and Resort, and he emphasized that neither himself nor any of his 1,000 chimp army would never ask a human to pick their noses. They like to pick their own and each others' noses, mahalo-verymuch.
