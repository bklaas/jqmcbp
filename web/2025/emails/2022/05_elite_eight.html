<p>
What a <em>DESTRUCTIVE</em> round of sixteen that was! The talk of the boardwalk are the flashy Peacocks of Saint Peter's, once rated the U.S. News &amp; World Report #1 Jesuit School in Jersey City, New Jersey, now rated the #1 Jesuit School in Jersey City, New Jersey <em>and surrounding communities</em>, who knocked off another top contender in Purdue. I missed the game live as I was at my wife's community theater musical, where she killed it (in a good way!) singing a duet. But, I did stand in the lobby after the show watching the box score on my phone and hitting refresh repeatedly for the last two minutes of the game. What an exciting way to take in a sporting event! Highly recommended for anyone that doesn't like actually seeing sports but does like Myopia.
</p>
<p>
So, Saint Peters' win, coupled with two #1 seeds dropping (Gonzaga and Arizona), plus a surprise (not to me! they're legit) #10 seed Miami Storks/Hurricanes advancing has left most brackets in complete tatters. Fun! In fact, at this stage in the pool this is BY FAR the most Chimp-friendly composition to date. Stay tuned for UCOW! discussion below for more Chimpnalysis.

<h1>Losing Mascots: Let's Talk About Them!</h1>
<h2>Pointless Discussion about Losing Teams and Their Mascots</h2>

<p>
<a href = "https://youtu.be/DdWZKb659K0">Some bands</a> are <a href = "https://youtu.be/NM60iVDu79Y">"Big in Japan"</a>. The Candymeister, by contrast, is Big in Michigan. So, this brings me no pleasure, but SHAME on you Michigan*. Michigan University are known as the Wolverines but, and this just makes me want to spit, they HAVE NO MASCOT. I can't even.
</p>
<p>
* I know, I know, half of you are Michigan State fans. Spartans and all of that, including a mascot. With all due respect to the Patrick "Spartypants" O'Boyles and Ethan "Go Green" Rays of the world, I'll feature the Spartan at some later date. You know, when your team actually makes it farther.
</p>
<p>And it's the wolverine! Do you know how scary a wolverine is? <b>THIS SCARY</b>:</p>
<img src = "https://mcusercontent.com/b94193d8d716ab819d32fb668/images/96fd88d5-655e-b20b-a2e6-00feedbf1b06.jpg" width = "100%" />
<p>Too scary? Do a deal with Marvel and bring in a cartoon instead!</p>
<img src = "https://mcusercontent.com/b94193d8d716ab819d32fb668/images/f8056bf7-bf93-e404-afa6-07a138284a02.png" width = "50%" />

<p>SHAME</p>

<p>Moving on from Michigan SHAME, today we get to talk about a Very Special Subset of the Mascot population: The Vocational Mascot. Unlike the lazy Wildcats, Bruins, and Bulldogs, the Vocational Mascot has a job to do. And that job is, by gosh, to GET. THINGS. DONE.</p>

<p>
I'm going to start with a mascot not even eligible for the NCAA Tournament, as it's a high school. Much to my daughters' chagrin, I'm going to highlight their crosstown rivals the Minneapolis Washburn Millers. There's nothing not to like about the Miller. As a mascot, he's tough and menacing, but off the court he's grinding flour for our breads, muffins, and most importantly, waffles.
</p>

<p>The Miller is an excellent mascot. One of the best.</p>
<p>
<img src = "https://mcusercontent.com/b94193d8d716ab819d32fb668/images/3a7697bb-fda4-96ca-faf5-4a5750ed5e7a.jpg" width = "40%" />

<p>Now for the freshly-vanquished Vocational Mascots. Let's start with the Providence Friars. I'm not sure what a Friar is supposed to do at a basketball game, and I'm concerned his duties at the Abbey might be being neglected, but clearly one of his activities is getting hoisted in the air.</p>

<img src = "https://mcusercontent.com/b94193d8d716ab819d32fb668/images/f8067a3f-f663-722b-20f2-28e2b930d153.jpg" width = "50%"/>
<p>Next up we've got the Purdue Boilermaker. Just look at that hammer! What kind of boiler is he making with that? I love the work ethic on display here, but seriously I'm not going to trust my boiler work to someone with that tool.
<img src = "https://mcusercontent.com/b94193d8d716ab819d32fb668/images/36481c40-8ac1-4781-7a86-9e65af6af42f.jpg" width = "50%" />

<p>Lastly we've got the Texas Tech Red Raider. I'm not sure what job a Red Raider exactly is, but it's not like I'm going to doubt whatever it is Red has in mind. Dude does <em>not</em> like to be crossed.</p>
<img src = "https://mcusercontent.com/b94193d8d716ab819d32fb668/images/37f56e34-fef5-e538-b18d-81f16860ae4b.gif" width="50%" />

<p>That was the 2018 version of Raider Red. Since then, Red has received an Upgrayedd*, receiving both eyes** and a cartoonishly large gun.***</p>
<img src = "https://mcusercontent.com/b94193d8d716ab819d32fb668/images/d1577a1f-23de-e647-a74c-490d93692dfb.jpg" width="50%" />
<p>* that's two D's for a double dose of <a href = "https://youtu.be/gzEMGfR_BtQ">Upgrayedd</a>.</p>
<p>** Lance "Whatchamacallit" Van Houten pointed out that he considers the Saint Mary's Gael (featured in last email) as "The Windowless Van" of mascots. If the Gael is behind the wheel of said van, then the eyeless 2018 Red Raider is sitting shotgun.</p>
<p>*** Of course he's got a gun. It's Texas, y'all.</p>

<h1>Upsets...who picked 'em</h1>
<h2>Highlighting those brave souls that chose oddball longshots to win games</h2>

<p>
Upsets abounded in this round: 57 had Houston winning, 40 had Arkansas, 31 had North Carolina. The biggest surprises, Miami and Saint Peters, had 10 and 4, respectively. Important to point out that the most competitive of those 4 Saint Peters pickers currently sits in 702nd place. The least competitive? Andrew Mossburg has secured his THIRD Biggest Loser in all of JQMCBP with 16 points. 11 of those 16 points were Saint Peters wins. Luckily he's got Norfolk State beating Saint Peters in the next round, so his spot at the bottom is not in jeopardy.
