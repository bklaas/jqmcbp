<p>
For the rookies:
What I do is send out email updates (personalized just for your entry!) several times during the course of the tournament. I go on and on and on over seemingly meaningless minutia. It might seem meaningless but...well okay, it's meaningless. But we'll have fun, or your money back.*
</p>

<p>
In addition to the emails, there's lots of important, vital resources available with your web browser. Evaluate how risky your picks are with the J Factor, see who picked brackets like yours with the Scientific Similarity Index. As the tournament progresses, figure out who has no chance of winning at the Hall of Shame! Generate pointless head-to-head graphs! Check out the linky links at the bottom of the email or head to <a href = "http://benklaas.com/jqmcbp/leaderboard.cgi">The Leaderboard</a> as a jumping off point.
</p>

<p>
As I've done for the past few years, I'm sending emails through the appropriately named <a href = "http://mailchimp.com">MailChimp</a> mass email service. This is Lucky the Chimp's favorite email service, and because it actually sends emails that people tend to receive. However, MailChimp will not allow me to send multiple emails to the same email address. So, if you signed up several brackets on one email address, you only be getting one personalized email for each entry. How about we call this a "feature" and call an end to the tech talk.
</p>

<p>
* Refund applications need to be filed in triplicate and mailed to the Johnny Quest Memorial Candy Bar Pool Customer Service Department, care of its Parent Corporation, Slaptronics Personal Massage Therapy and Self Help Video Distribution Corporation of Netherland Antilles (nasdaq:SPMTSHVDCNA). Or you could contact your congressperson, which will give you a similar outcome.

<h1>Whahappened?</h1>

<p>
I watched some basketball tonight. It was, objectively, very bad basketball. I'm watching the last game of the night right now, Gonzaga vs. Seton Hall. The top player from Seton Hall just set the O-fer record for 3-pointers, 0-10. Earlier I saw Kentucky vs. Stony Brook, and the bricks could have built a house. But that's okay, this thing isn't about basketball, it's about candy. And mascot discussion! Some alternative mascot names I thought up while watching bad basketball:
</p>

<p>
<ul>
	<li>The Androllers of Little Rock</li>
	<li>The Trout of Stony Brook</li>
	<li>The Gonzaga Agaznog, because that would be a sweet palindrome</li>
	<li>The Seton Hall of Justice</li>
</ul>

<h1>Upsets...who picked 'em</h1>
<h2>Highlighting those brave souls that chose oddball longshots to win games</h2>

<p>
The biggest upsets of the day were Yale over the Laser Lemon clad Baylor Bears and Little Rock beating the Purdue Boilermakers, but 144 and 76 candy seekers tabbed those teams, respectively.

<h1>Mailbag</h1>

<p>
Well, the mailbag was full the last few days. Full of things like "your site is down" and "you sent me a link that doesn't work" and "hey your site is down" and "did you know you don't have the brackets in the right order?" and "YOUR SITE IS DOWN". It's been a tough week, technically, yet somehow 757 of you still managed to enter successfully. Now that we're through that, write me something publishable! I'm old and tired and need to crowd-source my content like the rest of the internet!

<h1>Whose champion bit it?</h1>
<h2>Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose, but it never sucks worse than when the team you picked to win it all loses it all. It's even worse when I publish it for all to read!</h2>

<p>11 misguided candy seekers lost their champion today. Chant as Mark Jones heartily tried, "Let's Go Peay! Let's Go Peay!", it wasn't enough.</p>

<div class = 'pre'>
Florida Gulf Coast: Allen 'Thunderstick' Witt
Austin Peay: Mark Jones
Colorado: Ian
Arizona: Kathie Grover, Alexandria Chittenden
Purdue: Larry F Ochs, Sarah Ogborn, Grandma Kirch
Seton Hall: Aloy Makalinao
Baylor: Connor Byers, D Backs

20 people who listed these schools as their alma mater wept tears of agony as their squads came up short. Let's stand united with Jeral Poskey of UNC Wilmington. Tonight we are all Seahawks. We are all Seahawks.

<h1>Candy Bar of the Day</h1>
<h2>where I single out one or two of my favorite candy selections</h2>

<p>
WOW. There's always a few people trolling for hard-to-buy candy bars to stump me. Some of those choices have even been won by past champions: Dulce De Leche M&amp;M's, only available while being test marketed in certain Southwest US hispanic neighborhoods. The Melo Bar, a liquer-filled Carmelo Anthony signature candy bar available only in Denver area King Soopers grocery stores. Finally last year I needed to use eBay to find a dessicated, hope-he-didn't-eat-it 20 year old Kirby Puckett bar. But this candy is next level on the Troll-O-Meter: <a href = "https://toakchocolate.com/shop/products/">To'ak Chocolate</a>, fine chocolates from the forests of Ecuador. From the website:
</p>


<div class = 'quote'>
Made with the care of a vintage winemaker and precision of a premium small-batch whisky
</div>

<p>Hmmm, that sounds pretty good. I like wine and whisky, so why not some craft chocolate to go with it? Sign me up!</p>

<div class = 'quote'>
A series of sensory impressions that tell a narrative of the origins of a chocolate and its journey from earth to tree to bean to bar.
</div>

<p>I think I'm still interested, but this is getting a wee bit pretentious. Okay, I'll order some.</p>

<div class = 'pre'>
Shopping Cart:
Vintage 2014 Spanish Elm × 1	$315.00
Vintage 2014 Cognac Cask × 1	$345.00
Rain Harvest 2015 Dark × 1	$270.00
Rain Harvest 2015 Light × 1	$270.00
Total $1,200.00
</div>

<p>WAT?!?! $1200 for FOUR chocolate bars? Does it come with a fully functional golf cart? Are the wrappers lined with a sum total of $1190? No? Okay, count me WAY OUT then.</p>

<p>Impressively, three different JQMCBP participants went full To'ak on me: Michael Wooley-Ousdahl, Nikhil Bhandarkar, and current front-runner Ken Mills. Ken even specified he wanted the To'ak Piedra de Plata 2014 vintage* bar, which goes for about $245. Why aim so low Ken? Next time go for the Cognac Cask!

<p>* Chocolate, like milk, peanuts, and sushi, should not have a "vintage"</p>
