<p>In case you haven't seen it on the website already, I'm riding 150 miles to support the MS society in (hopefully post-quarantine) June. The JQMCBP is always and forever 100% free, but if you're so inclined <a href = "https://main.nationalmssociety.org/goto/beat_larry_2020">you may donate buckets of cash to my ride here</a>. This is my 9th MS-150, and my goals remain the same: raise &gt;$1000 so I can access the VIP toilets, and to BEAT LARRY.
