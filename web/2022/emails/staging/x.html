<h1>Bugging you for charity</h1>
<p>In case you haven't seen it on the website already, I'm riding 150 miles to support the MS society. The JQMCBP is always and forever 100% free, but if you're so inclined <a href = "http://bit.ly/bkMS150_2019">you may donate buckets of cash to my ride here</a>. This is my 8th MS-150, and my goal remains the same: raise &gt;$1000 so I can access the VIP toilets, and to BEAT LARRY.
