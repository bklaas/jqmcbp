<h1>Losing Mascots: Let's Talk About Them!</h1>
<h2>Pointless Discussion about Losing Teams and Their Mascots</h2>

<p>
The second round had 16 mascots heading with giant heads bowed to the exits. They may have all been losers, but it was an EXCELLENT set of mascots. Here they are in rank order, from lamest to awesomest. It's basically Mascot Gold from #11 on down.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Fighting Illini</li>
<li>Wildcats</li>
<li>Tigers</li>
<li>Cowboys</li>
<li>Sooners</li>
<li>Red Raiders</li>
<li>Mountaineers</li>
<li>Scarlet Knights</li>
<li>Buffaloes</li>
<li>Jayhawks</li>
<li>Hawkeyes</li>
<li>Bobcats</li>
<li>Gators</li>
<li>Badgers</li>
<li>Terrapins</li>
<li>MEAN GREEN</li>
</ul>

<p>Some musings on the list</p>
<p>
The <b>Rutgers Scarlet Knights</b> used to be called the Chanticleers, which is a fighting chicken. They are now the Scarlet Knights because, <a href = "https://www.theuconnblog.com/2010/10/7/1734636/the-sad-pathetic-history-of-the-scarlet-knight">according to this UConn blogger, they are all a bunch of lazy pretty boy traitors.</a> I think Scarlet Knights sounds pretty cool, but I speak for all of us in saying <b>BRING BACK THE RUTGERS FIGHTING CHICKENS!</b>
</p>

<p>
Texas Tech used to be the Texas Tech Matadors. THE MATADORS! WHAT? HOW DO YOU DUMP THAT NAME?? However, now they are the <b>Texas Tech Red Raiders</b>, which is admittedly also pretty cool. They have some mascot issues though, in that they are represented by both the horse-riding "Masked Rider", who is mysterious and awesome, and Raider Red, who is RIDICULOUS and awesome. I favor the latter, as evidenced by this photo essay I did while visiting a practice session of the Final Four a few years ago in Minneapolis.

<p>
<b>Ohio Bobcats</b>-- all that needs to be said about the Ohio Bobcat can be viewed in <a href = "https://youtu.be/lZWvFmjEdDk">this EPIC MASCOT battle</a> between the Ohio Bobcat and THE Ohio State Buckeye. An aside, OSU is pretty close to unique in the mascot world in that it is just a nut off of a tree. I mean, srsly. LOL.
</p>

<p>
<b>Bucky Badger</b>. Great school. Great mascot. Will punch you. What's not to love?
</p>

<p>
<b>Maryland Terrapins:</b><br /><a href = "https://youtu.be/CMNry4PE93Y" alt = "I like turtles"><img src = "https://mcusercontent.com/b94193d8d716ab819d32fb668/images/172ff075-0ffa-4225-8c77-ff1552f9f7ac.png" /></a>
</p>

<p>
Which brings us finally to the <b>MEAN GREEN</b>.
</p>
<p>
There are competing anecdotes about the origin of <b>The North Texas Mean Green</b>. The first one, <a href = "https://meangreensports.com/sports/2018/7/6/trads-MeanGreen-html.aspx">chronicled in meangreensports.com</a>, describes superfan Sidney Sue Green cheering on North Texas in 1966 coining the term via her cheers:

<div class = "quote">
We were way behind and she started hollering, 'Come on green, get mean,' or 'Here we go, mean green,' or variants on that. Then it became popular with some of the students and some of the other fans. So it caught on.
</div>

<p>
This story is misinformation brought on by an evil cabal lead by Meangreensports, the government of Venezuela, and probably some sort of pizza restaurant. IT IS FALSE AND AWFUL AND SHOULD BE CONDEMNED.
</p>

<p>The real origin of Mean Green, from Wikipedia:
<p>
<div class = "quote">The name "Mean Green" was adopted by fans and media in 1966 for a North Texas football defensive squad that finished the season second in the nation against the rush. That school year, Joe Greene, then a sophomore at North Texas, played left defensive tackle on the football team</div>

<p>
They <b><i>literally named their school's team after Mean Joe Greene</i></b>. That is is so awesome.
</p>
this is a <b>MEAN GREEN:</b><br />
<img src = "https://mcusercontent.com/b94193d8d716ab819d32fb668/images/9a201ee0-d424-4403-84d8-09373ddd9c60.jpg" width = "100%" />
this is a <b>MEAN JOE GREENE:</b><br />
<img src = "https://mcusercontent.com/b94193d8d716ab819d32fb668/images/d2a19143-2d39-461f-b5a9-a79a1771e686.jpg" width = "100%"/>
<p>This is the canonical Mean Green origin story. All other Mean Green origin stories are false. The Meister has spoken.</p>

<hr class = 'section' />
<h1>FUN WITH DATA</h1>

<p>
Here are the wining JQMCBP scores and their associated J-factor scores since 2006, the year where my database became good enough to save such things.
</p>
<p>
The highest winning score was 2007's "ARUSSIAN" with 137 points.

<p>JQMCBP XXIII, in which there was no basketball, was intentionally insane. Last year Jess "Take 5" Larson won with 85 points and a jaw-dropping 36.36 J-factor.
</p>
<p>Factoring JQMCBP XXIII out, the lowest winning score was Meredith Hammons in 2014 with 94 points. J-factors of champions have ranged from 0.79 (2016 champ Julia "These are My Gummi Bears And I'll Share With My Sister At My Own Discretion" Larson) to 10.65 (2019, Tamara "Vosges Missing Link" Fink).
</p>
<p>
It remains to be seen if this year's winning score drops below that level, but it certainly could. Aside from Mark Dyal who is <i>killing it,</i> a great portion of the Leaderboard already has RtT's below 94. When Oral Roberts, Oregon State, Loyola Chicago, and Syracuse are 25% of the remaining teams, this is clearly a bracket buster kind of year.
</p>
<p>
Much more J-factor analysis coming in the next update. VERY IMPORTANT ANALYSIS!

<h2>I asked you if your alma mater was in the tournament*. Why? So I could make fun of you when they lose!</h2>

<p>
* not everyone
</p>

<p>
My own alma mater Wisconsin were dispatched, as were every remaining Big 10 team except Michigan. It's almost as if the selection committee had no real clue what was going on this year.
</p>
<p>
For about as long as I can remember someone has been entering with the name Fielding Yost, who was a long-time Michigan coach in the early 20th century. Props to putting down Mr. Yost's correct alma mater of West Virginia. That's some serious attention to detail on a very bizarre long-standing JQMCBP entry. Along these lines, see also: this year's entry of "Rev. John Monteith (1788-1868)", founder of the University of Michigan. I don't really understand all these Michigan fans and their callouts to Wolverines Past, but the historical detail is impressive.

<h1>Candy Bar of the Day</h1>
<h2>Where I give out fake awards for my favorite candy selections</h2>

<p>
The Livin' Large Award
</p>
<p>
When it comes to upsizing your candy, JQMCBP selections have a long and storied past.
</p>
<p>
This year, like all others, features the predictable choice of $100,000 Grand Bar*, in which one-hundred thousand * a grand = 100 MILLION dollar bar. Which is a big bar. Todd Dankers, you're livin' large, but you don't get the award.
</p>
<p>
This year, like all others, features people "King-sizing" their candy. By my scientific count of staring at the sorted list of candybars, I count somewhere between 20 and my eyes are getting tired King Size bars. Well done, upsizers. No award.
</p>

<p>
Some other grandiose selections to mention: Charlotte "1 lb Milk Chocolate Hershey Bar", Larryjoe "3ft Twix" Brown, AJ "Giant 10lb Toblerone" Bower (as opposed to "Regular 10lb Toblerone"?), Mark "Mallo Cup 4 pack" Weiss, which is 4 more Mallo Cups than I care to consume, Ben "movie theater sized anything" Halpern (congrats on your teeth-extracting box of Jujyfruits), 2004 Champion Greg "Thanks A Million Giant 2-Pound Chocolate Bar Gift Box" Rhoades, and finally four of you that wanted "World's Largest _insert candy here_".
</p>

<p>
The Livin' Large Award goes to <b>DANK's choice of 5lb Blue Raspberry Gummy Bear</b>. EW.
</p>
<p>DANK, while you are sitting in 548th place and have exhausted all chances of winning, I am attending your wedding in June. I have a great idea for a gift. Careful lifting it, it's gonna weigh like five pounds.
</p>

<p>
* to clarify: it's $100,000 bar or 100 grand bar, but not $100,000 Grand Bar.
</p>
<hr class = 'section' />
<h1>Bugging you for charity</h1>
<p>In case you haven't seen it on the website already, I'm riding my bike more miles than I'm fit to ride in June to support the MS society. The JQMCBP is always and forever 100% free, but if you're so inclined <a href = "https://mssociety.donordrive.com/participant/BenKlaas">you may donate buckets of cash to my ride here</a>. This is my 9th MS-150, and my goal remains the same: raise &gt;$1000 so I can access the VIP toilets, and to BEAT LARRY.

<hr class = 'section' />

<h1>Enough with the crap, who's ahead?</h1>

<h2>Top 10 Humans</h2>

<p>
<p>
Mark "Peanut M&amp;M" Fidder leads the pack with 46, but look to Mark "Milky Way" Dyal as the frontrunner right now, with 15 of his 16 picks for the next round still alive. Shout out to college roomie Paul "World's King Size Candy Cigarettes" Wadzinske, setting a good example for The Children with his candy selection.
