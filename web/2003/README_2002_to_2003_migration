Here's what's needed:

html space: copy 2002/ directory space to 2003/
perl space: copy /home/bklaas/jqmcbp_2002 to /home/bklaas/jqmcbp_2003
change all references in cgis, html space and perl space from 2002 to 2003

following programs need to be fixed for region pairings:

johnnyquest.cgi
jq_admin.cgi
winners.cgi
--check out .pl files as well in cgi-bin and webspace perl dirs

backup up johnnyquest db to jq_2002

use jq_admin.cgi through browser to clear out fields in teams table (*don't just delete records*);
do this only after cgi has been changed for new region pairings
clear database of all values in players, games, player_info, players tables. Do not clear teams table. Let jq_admin.cgi do that.
use clear_db.sql in /home/bklaas/jqmcbp_2002 to do this.
command:
mysql -u root -phoopoe < clear_db.sql

change text as necessary throughout
new graphics as needed

test it!
