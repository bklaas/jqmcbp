<p>
The whole point of this thing is fun and candy. Unlike other office NCAA pools, this one won't have you
stressed out about the $1-$5 you are going to lose because you picked Sam Houston State in the upset of the decade. The stakes are candy, and you can't lose. Just
click on the admission ticket below and start making your selections. 

<P>Make your picks by clicking on the
button by each of your projected winning teams. Submit each page of your
choices by clicking on the GO BEN GO! button at the bottom of the form.
If you want to go back to change any selections, just click &quot;Back&quot;
on your browser and make your changes. Just make sure that you submit these
changes with the GO BEN GO! button to process your new picks. Fill in each
round's picks, and select a candy bar, and that's it! Game On!

<P><a href = "http://www.ncaasports.com/basketball/mens/brackets/printable">Printable</a> and <a href="http://www.ncaasports.com/basketball/mens/brackets/viewable">Viewable</a> brackets are available from 
the NCAA, however once the tourney starts you will be able to view your selections Supa-Fancy Style&#8482; from <a href="http://www.benklaas.com/cgi-bin/player_bracket_selection.cgi">benklaas.com</a>. 

<hr>

<P>So, that's the scoop. As in past years, I will religiously send out irreverant email rants as the tournament progresses, thus lowering your work productivity and allowing you to spend countless hours following teams like the Hilltopers of Western Kentucky, the Salukis of Southern Illinois, the Seahawks of North Carolina-Wilmington and of course the Bearkats of Sam Houston State...
