I'm a bit delinquent in getting the end-of-sweet-16 round email out. I attribute that tardiness to the following issues, in this order: Work, Parenting two girls, ages 3 and 4, and Laziness. While laziness falls at the end of that list, its importance cannot be understated. For those sitting around all weekend, listlessly hitting "check mail" over and over again waiting for my missive to arrive, I apologize. Also, get a life.

Last week I spoke more than once about the understated brilliance of the Western Kentucky Hilltopers' mascot, "Big Red". Today I bring you the Anti Big Red. Give this video at least 20-30 seconds, it will be worth it:

Beware of the Bear: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WhhTjgPXxI

Also in the news last week, a rabid bobcat attacked patrons at the Chaparral Bar in Cottonwood Arizona. This has absolutely nothing to do with anything, except for the fact that I find the play-by-play description comedy gold. My favorite quote:

"That's when Derek Oliver showed you can find a good man late at night in a Cottonwood bar.
'He was coming right towards two women,' Oliver said. 'So, I pushed them out of the way. That's when he got me. It wrapped itself around my leg.'
Worse yet, the bobcat was moving up Oliver's leg.
'I punched it in the face real good,' Oliver said."

Mailbag, Part I

Ben,

As you are certainly aware, Michelle R. Young is the current leader (candymeister's note: Michelle "R" has now fallen from the top spot. See footnote*).  Here in the Young household, we are very proud of her achievement.  Of course, whether her dominance at the Elite 8 can be maintained through the next round remains to be seen.  There is precedent for such excellence here.  You may already have uncovered this item in your Bag o' Random Facts (you do have such a bag, don't you?), but I wanted to bring it to your attention in case you have been too busy identifying the obscure connections that link AimRepp to Poor Bob.  I finished in second place, winning a Big Fat Nothing, some years ago.  I have every confidence that Michelle R (as she likes to be called) can match or exceed that level.

I know you'll be rooting for her in your next update (I hope I've included enough parenthetical comments to raise this communique to the level typically expected in this particular genre of literature -- the "contact" email for the CandyMeister.)

Have a nice day.

* The top spot has been taken over by Ed Norstrom**
** Who was once pictured on the cover of Sports Illustrated***
*** No really, he was. I think I might still have the photo around here somewhere****
**** Well, crud, I can't find it, but Ed really was on the cover of Sports Illustrated, albeit fuzzily in a crowd watching an NCAA game*****
***** Seriously.

Hey Ben,
How about making a "past champions" filter?

Great Idea! Here it is:

Boo Rah Rah --

Erv 'Dad' Klaas actually lost two alma maters, as he holds degrees from both Missouri (B.S.) and Kansas (Ph.D.). Last week Dad also failed to be honored by the Ames Iowa Parks and Recreation department because he was chasing geese in a truck in rural Nebraska. True story:

Have Michigan entries continued to dominate JQMCBP, despite the state's economic woes?
A: JQMCBP is recession proof. Experts believe this is due to JQMCBP's extreme affordability

Candy Bar of the Day --

The "Good Thing You're Tied for 651st Place" Award, goes to Rosalind "Red Skittles" Kroha for her selection of "10 lbs of skittles all red ones". Maybe when you become a world famous rockstar you can write such ridiculous requests into your live performance contracts, often known as "backstage riders". If you work hard, perhaps you can beat out the current best backstage rider from the Foo Fighters:
