Hey Ben,
<p>
I'm not sure why I'm inviting this upon myself but I'll blame alcohol.
In the spirit of making a meaningless waste out of valuable time I
offer the following for your consideration:
<p>
As a JQMCBP regular and SPMTSHVDCNA shareholder in absentia I must say
that I was truly impressed by the complete and total lack of coverage
over "plucky" (AP) "pesky" (ESPN) Purdue's second round loss to
"resilient" (ESPN) "defending national champion" (AP) Florida.  Never
mind that four JQMCBP hopefuls picked Florida to cut down the nets in
Atlanta, there was also a single insane entrant who picked Purdue to
win it all in one Stephanie Stalter who was notably absent from the
"Whose champion bit it?" (TM) list.  While Stephanie's selection could
have been and, in point of fact, most probably was a random senseless
act, there was still at least one Purdue alumnus that didn't make the
"Boo Rah Rah" (TM) list.
<p>
I can understand not mentioning the "plucky" (AP) "pesky" (ESPN)
Boilers when they actually win, the national media certainly doesn't,
but I figured the one sure thing was that JQMCBP would take time out to
highlight their loss in a humiliating fashion in the local media.
Maybe Madison-based NBC 15 will get it right?  OK, Purdue has become a
perennial doormat team but isn't that what JQMCBP is all about?  I
mean, aside from the candy bar obsession of course.  I guess I'll just
have to wait another three years for Purdue's next NCAA loss with Matt
Painter at the helm.  Oh, sure, Bruce Weber might have been a better
choice but we all know how that turned out.  Well, that's neither here
nor there nor in the Sweet 16.  Hail Purdue.
<p>
