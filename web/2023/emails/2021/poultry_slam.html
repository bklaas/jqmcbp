</div>
<div class = 'email'>

<p>
This story is about my experience caring for, and being haunted by, a turkey with a disturbing neurological disease.
</p>
<p>
I grew up in central Iowa, and as a teenager I had a variety of agriculturally-based summer jobs. Mostly I de-tasseled corn, which is particularly hellish summer work, but pays well. But when I was 18 I got a big break, a summer job working as an animal caretaker at a large US Department of Agriculture veterinary research facility. I had aspirations of a career working with animals, so this was a great opportunity.
</p>
<p>
The lab tested vaccines on a variety of farm livestock. I fed and cleaned up after horses, donkeys, cattle, sheep, goats, chickens...and turkeys. The poultry were kept in building 5, at the end of a row of Pizza Hut-looking structures along the main road of the facility. Building 5 was my last task of the day, and my trepidation for dealing with building 5 would mount as the day progressed. Building 5 was the home of the star-gazing turkey.
</p>
<p>
When I'd walk into the turkey room, for the first several seconds upon entering the 15 or so turkeys confined there would all appear pretty much the same. Every day I'd fool myself into thinking that something magical had happened-- maybe he got away, maybe he got better. But then one of the heads looking at me from the flock would start lolling backwards until its beak would point directly at the sky, and I'd know that my daily fear had once again been realized. The star-gazing turkey was alive and well. Star-gazing is a neurological disorder that afflicts birds, and in a typical farm this bird would have probably been culled, but this turkey was part of an active scientific study so they kept it around.
</p>
<p>
The turkeys in this room were kept in a 12'x12' platform cage about 3 feet off the floor. My job was to spray down the floor of the cage, a thick rubberized chicken wire material called "tenderfeet", and then climb up into the cage and replenish the food and water for them, which was kept in the middle of the cage. 
</p>
<p>
Before I go further I should explain that the typical behavior of a healthy domestic turkey when you enter into a confined space with it is to get as far away from you as possible. This works out great for getting the cleaning and feeding chores done. I'd climb up into the cage and the turkeys would avoid me, and I'd have the space I needed. However, the star-gazing turkey was different. While its core instinct was the same, "Human! Run Away!", its wires were quite literally crossed. Its forward was backward, its left was right and its right was left. 
</p>
<p>
When I would get into the cage, this turkey would try to get away from me...and run directly at me. As it ran at me, it would get more freaked out and try to run away, which due to its affliction meant speeding up at me. My reaction, each and every day, all summer long, was the same. I'd also panic. I'd run from this brain-addled bird, with its head pointed at the heavens but its legs running right for me. There was only one way to run, and that was around the cage, and right towards the rest of the confined turkeys. They'd freak out and run from me, and we'd spin around and around with increasing speed, the star-gazer, me, and the rest of the turkeys. An outside observer happening into the middle of this scene probably wouldn't have been able to figure out what was going on, other than every player involved seemed to be filled with terror, and that I was remarkably good at filling food and water bowls while running in circles at a dead sprint.
</p>
<p>
It's been more than 20 years since that summer, and I'd like to say that I'm over it, but I still don't eat turkey. Not even at Thanksgiving.
</p>
