<em>(taps mic...taps mic...)</em> Is this on? It is? Oh great! HELLOOOO and welcome to the <b>TWENTY FIFTH</b> iteration, incarnation, incantation...all the "i" words...of the Johnny Quest Memorial Candy Bar Pool, confectionally known as JQMCBP! This year has roped in 754 humans* in this year's Quest. Everyone enters with one goal: sweet, sweet candy. Almost all will leave with dreams shattered. I wish you nothing but good fortune in this Fool's Journey.
</p>

<p>
<b>For the rookies:</b><br />
What I do is send out email updates (personalized just for your entry!) several times during the course of the tournament. I go on and on and on over seemingly meaningless minutia. It might seem meaningless but...well okay, it's meaningless. But we'll have fun, or your money back.**
</p>

<p>
In addition to the emails, there's lots of important, vital resources available with your web browser. Evaluate how risky your picks are with the <a href = "https://benklaas.com/jqmcbp/whatsyourj.cgi">J Factor</a>, see who picked brackets like yours with the <a href = "https://benklaas.com/jqmcbp/sss.cgi">Scientific Similarity Index</a>. As the tournament progresses, figure out who has no chance of winning at the <a href = "https://benklaas.com/jqmcbp/hallofshame.cgi">Hall of Shame!</a> Generate pointless <a href = "https://benklaas.com/jqmcbp/hallofshame.cgi">head-to-head graphs</a>! Every one of my emails will contain these linky links at the bottom of the email, or instead just head to <a href = "http://benklaas.com/jqmcbp/leaderboard.cgi">The Leaderboard</a> as a jumping off point.
</p>

<p>
As I've done for the past few years, I'm sending emails through the appropriately named <a href = "http://mailchimp.com">MailChimp</a> mass email service. This is Lucky the Chimp's favorite email service, and because it actually sends emails that people tend to receive. However, MailChimp will not allow me to send multiple emails to the same email address. So, if you signed up several brackets on one email address, you only be getting one personalized email for each entry. How about we call this a "feature" and call an end to the tech talk.
</p>

<p>
* and 1,001 chimps. This number has been remarkably steady.
</p>

<p>
** Refund applications need to be filed in triplicate and mailed to the Johnny Quest Memorial Candy Bar Pool Customer Service Department, care of its Parent Corporation, Slaptronics Personal Massage Therapy and Self Help Video Distribution Corporation of Netherland Antilles (nasdaq:SPMTSHVDCNA). Or you could contact your congressperson, which will give you a similar outcome.

<h1>Losing Mascots: Let's Talk About Them!</h1>
<h2>Pointless Discussion about Losing Teams and Their Mascots</h2>

<p>
We had so many great losing mascots today!
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        The Vermont Catamounts
    </li>
<p>A Catamount is derived from "Cat of the mountain," which is a mountain lion. I love the colloquial and bucolic nature of the Catamount name. So perf, so Vermont.</p>
    <li>
        The South Dakota State Jackrabbits
    </li>
<p>Like the Catamount, a geographically appropriate mascot. Fast, big ears, cute. But, a prey species. I might have suggested they go with Jackalope.</p>
<img src = "https://mcusercontent.com/b94193d8d716ab819d32fb668/images/af802c7c-856c-17d2-a5a4-3db28150f654.jpeg" width = "70%"/>
    <li>
        The Longwood Lancers
    </li>
<div class = "quote">
The Lancer mascot is Elwood, a horse, and the official logo features a horse's head atop a lance.
</div>
<p>I'm going to suggest they take a second look at their logo description there. Because EW.</p>
    <li>
        The San Francisco Dons
    </li>
<p>Who's got two ginormous thumbs and name means "Distinguished Gentleman"? THIS GUY</p>
<img src = "https://mcusercontent.com/b94193d8d716ab819d32fb668/images/bed82136-ad26-595b-cf39-367b28dabd61.png" width = "70%"/>

    <li>
        The Akron Zips
    </li>
<img src = "https://mcusercontent.com/b94193d8d716ab819d32fb668/images/57548fed-2a16-1e22-69d2-a98fae61402d.jpg" class = "float-right" />
<p>And last but not least the Akron Zips. Where do I start? From the beginning I guess...the Zips were named after a rubber shoe, that's right a rubber shoe, manufactured by the local BF Goodrich plant. The shoes, and the team, were actually named the Zippers, but towards the middle of the 20th century it seems that the young folk of Akron were transitioning away from fastening the flies on their pantaloons with buttons, and opting instead for a new fangled invention, the "zipper". Not wanting to be associated with such a device, the university shortened their name to just "Zips".
</p>
<p>Now for the mascot. A kangaroo! What's zippier than a Kangaroo? Like Vermont's Catamount and South Dakota State's Jackrabbit, the woods around Akron are teeming with native kangaroos*. Zippy the Kangaroo is, true story, one of only eight college mascots in the U.S. that identify as female. You go, girl!
 </ul>
<p>
* they are not.

<h1>Upsets...who picked 'em</h1>
<h2>Highlighting those brave souls that chose oddball longshots to win games</h2>

<p>
Saint Peter's University. Not heard of it? I'm surprised, US News &amp; World Report ranked Saint Peter's the #1 Jesuit college in all of Jersey City, New Jersey. So anyway, this school that you've <em>definitely</em> heard of managed a wild win against #2 seed Kentucky, lighting so many JQMCBP brackets on fire. How many picked them? Turns out 3.7% of you did, along with 11.2% knowing the Richmond Spiders would defeat Iowa (more on Iowa down the page).
</p>

<div class = 'pre'>
Saint Peters (28):  Andrew Mossburg, Carolin Bier, Cole Beatty, Erasmus Otis Haven (1820-1881), Espen Williams, Gwen D, Heather Parkinson, Helen, Jessica Wiltse, June Housenga, Li Dai, Lindsey LaGrou, Liv khoury , Liv khoury , Maria Seipelt, Mark Jones, Mary Herrmann, Mary Lou Lombardi-Butler, Mason Miles, Maya O'Hare, Nabulsi Kids, Nicholas LeTarte, Owen Sagen, Parker Iamdog, Pat Bowne, Sebastian butler II , sudeepti, WillAyeAm

<h1>Whose champion bit it?</h1>
<h2>Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose, but it never sucks worse than when the team you picked to win it all loses it all. It's even worse when I publish it for all to read!</h2>

<p>
If you lost your champion on Day 1, are you out of it? I mean, probably. Special shout out to Lance Van Houten who wanted to be honored for Fastest Loser Award, but I can't do that because so many others of you picked Iowa to win it all (Iowa: Disappointing Iowans for 25 years of JQMCBP play). Technically Riley Young wins that award, as Colorado State was the first loss of the day.
</p>

<p>
Sixty-one in total lost their champion pick today, which is a pretty big number. Mostly Kentucky.
</p>

<div class = 'pre'>
Akron: Mommy Shanahan, Roxy Iamdog

Kentucky: Jake Lowenstern , Keith Brown, Thomas Joseph, Andrew Moore, Chris 'charby' Charbonneaux, David Lucas, John Lucas, Julie Smith, Trevor Shepich, Eddie Sander, Ryan Ahearn, Sam Niyo, Steve Carlson, Joe Cislo, Brenda Ochs, heather lucas-foster, Curtis Mitchell, Michael Shim, Christy Griesheimer, Tom Lynch, Martie Lucas, Wayne Lucas, Steve White, Nick White (Other Son of Steve), Tom Hoag, Jim walker, Dave Bush, Usha D, Judy Johnson, Kerie Whelan, John Brookhart, Tina Ferreter, Alex chittenden , Owen MacDonell, Dave Metcalfe , Paul Wadzinske, Jason Wulff, Sam Hoag, John Smith, Greg Rhoades, Sam Housker

Longwood: Todd Vorisek

<h1>Boo Rah Rah</h1>
<h2>I asked you if your alma mater was in the tournament. Why? So I could make fun of you when they lose!</h2>

<p>
Meister's note: Since I ignore the play-in games that happened Tues/Wed, if you were an alum of Indiana or Wyoming I don't know which it was since for the first few days of entry it was listed as Indiana/Wyoming pending the outcome of their qualifying game. As I did last year with the UC-Mighigan State Spartabruins, this year I will refer to your school as the Indiyoming Cowboosiers.
</p>

<div class = 'pre'>
41* in total lost their alma maters on Day 1:

Norfolk State: Dave Bush**

Marquette: Karen McCartney , Curtis Stalter, Peter Benavente, Jodi Eastberg, Penny Alt-Gehrman, Bill McGrail

Akron: Mike Shanahan, Dad Shananagins

Indiyoming Cowboosiers: Mike Riggins, Moira Riggins, J. Stevens, Kurt Anders,

Kentucky: Wayne Lucas, Kelsey Leopold 

Colorado State: Jim Bell, Jack Genadek

San Diego State: Rollie Empizo, Eanie Meanie, Matt Clark, ELIAD PRDGER, Lady Whistledown , Nate Reed

South Dakota State: Jacks Fan

Iowa: Helen Copley, Lance Van Houten, Jennifer Chittenden, AARON CHITTENDEN, Greg Brown, Jeff Chungath, Dave Sedgwick, Rich Lyle, Abby Chungath, Theodore Chungath, Alex Russell, Adam Chittenden, C. Stiddy, Ron Valenta, William Hotchkiss

Vermont: Sara Mitchell

Connecticut: Mary Lou Lombardi-Butler

* 40. Dave's a liar.
** No Dave, you didn't go to Norfolk State. We did, however, spend a fantastic afternoon together at the Norfolk airport last October waiting interminably for flights home. This, however, does not qualify you for a degree from Norfolk State. Well, not that I know of.

<h1>Speaking of Indiyoming</h1>
<h2>What's going on here?</h2>

<img src = "https://mcusercontent.com/b94193d8d716ab819d32fb668/images/bd4f45ea-86b1-74d0-1d12-ca57c303d1e6.png" width = "80%" />
<p>
I'm glad you asked! I don't usually flex like this, but I was once an elite college basketball player*, the starting center for The Evergreen State College Geoducks**, where I set several school records***. As a result of this deep hoops IQ I have, I want to explain some things that might not be obvious to the casual fan.
</p>

<ol>
    <li>This cheerleader has an AMAZING vertical leap.</li>
    <li>Unfortunately, the back of the backboard is OUT OF BOUNDS, so the shot's not going to count.</li>
    <li>Also, she's not on the team, which is a serious strategy issue on Indiyoming's part.</li>
</ol>
<p>
In conclusion, while they were down 16 points at this point (and it got worse), this was not a good play call by the Cowboosiers. I'd probably fire the coach. Thanks, I'm glad I could break that play down for you!
</p>
<p>
* not true
</p>
<p>
** true
</p>
<p>
*** quickest to foul out, most ill-fitting jersey, most blocks in a game. Wait, that doesn't mean my shot getting blocked? Okay, scratch the last one.
</p>

<p>
BUT SRSLY, this picture above is from a really great highlight that had no need for my ridiculous embellishment. <a href = "https://twitter.com/bleacherreport/status/1504620808328556563?s=21">Have a look at the video</a>. Hat tip to Willy "Haribo Salz Gurken" Lee for the link.

<h1>Candy Bar of the Day</h1>
<h2>Where I give out fake awards for my favorite candy selections</h2>

<p>
The Epic Troll Award goes to Jason Wulff with his selection of What the 2nd Place Finisher Wanted. Well played, Mr. Wulff.

<h1>Bugging you for charity</h1>
<p>In case you haven't seen it on the website already, I'm riding my bike more miles than I'm fit to ride in June to support the MS society. The JQMCBP is always and forever 100% free, but if you're so inclined <a href = "https://mssociety.donordrive.com/participant/BenKlaas2022">you may donate buckets of cash to my ride here</a>. This is my 10th MS-150, and my goal remains much the same: raise &gt;$1500 so I can access the VIP toilets, and BEAT LARRY.

<hr class = 'section' />

<h1>Enough with the crap, who's ahead?</h1>

<h2>Top 10 Humans</h2>

<p>
After 12 games were played there was only 1 perfect bracket across the whole of JQMCBP, and her name was Kenna the Chimp. Even Kenna couldn't hold form to the end though, and our top Banana (pun fully intended) is Mercedes the Chimp at 15. Amongst humans, we've got a 7-way tie @ 14 points. As is always the case after Day 1, it's anyone's game still.
