<h1>Congratulations JQMCP XXV Champion!</h1>
<h1>Andy "Awesome See's Nuts &amp; Chews Bar" Calvert</h1>

<p>
It is my great honor, or if you're British or just odd, honour, to announce our JQMCBP XXV Champion Andy "Awesome See's Nuts &amp; Chews Bar" Calvert. Kansas's win over UNC last night gave Andy 96 points and a 1 point over Todd "whatchamacallit" Berenak, who in second place wins the traditional prize of BIG FAT NOTHING. Sonya Connolly rounds out the top 3 at 91*.
</p>

<img src = "https://mcusercontent.com/b94193d8d716ab819d32fb668/images/e5ec6a77-71b3-4c0d-c479-16e449bf03e3.png" width = "50%" class = "float-right"/>
<p>
Achieving Andy has achieved a never before achieved achievement, he is a <b>TWO-TIME JQMCBP CHAMPION</b>. He last won in 2005**, where his candy bar was, <em>checks notes</em>, See's Nuts &amp; Chews Bar. Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, "Consistency is the hobgoblin of tiny minds." Turns out, also of multiple JQMCBP champions! Andy, send me your address details and I'll send you some candy. To all others, better luck next year!
</p>

<p>Andy's candy choice has been called in reviews, and I'm not making this up, "Where are the nuts?," and "Not enough nuts," and "Where are the almonds?" and "These have changed." Looking closer at the wrapper though, I see that it's not See's Nuts &amp; Chews Bar but See's <b>NUT &amp; CHEW</b> bar. These reviewers are getting plenty of nut. Just enough nut for one chew.</p>

<p>
But wait, there's more! I won't end this year without giving props to the 1,000 Chimp Army! This year didn't end in victory, but it was the Best Year Ever for this vicious band of simians. Not one but two Chimps placed in the top 10! Mario the Chimp ended up in 6th place, the highest placing chimp in JQMCBP history. Mario had Saint Peters in the Final Four, and was one more Peacock victory away from running away with a delicous Krembanan. Dallas the Chimp snuck in at 9th place just one point behind Mario, and may have been the only bracket, human or chimp, that prognosticated a Kansas over UNC championship game. Also worth noting, with Mario finishing 6th this means 748 of 753 human beings could not beat a random coin flip bracket. Well done everyone!***
</p>

<p>I hope you all had a good time with this thing. I keep doing it, twenty-five times and counting, and you all seem to keep coming back. I'll take that as a sign. Or at least a cry for help.</p>
<p>Cheers and see you all next year!<br /><b>THE MEISTER</b></p>


<p>* Minor announcement buried in a footnote: I used to send out a 3rd place prize of "A CD of my choosing from my library," but I haven't actually done this in years. You see, I don't have any CDs any more. Everything's in "The Cloud," whatever that is, and I can't really send a cloud. So, congrats Sonya on your strong showing. I am also sending you nothing, but not BIG FAT NOTHING, as you didn't do THAT well.</p>

<p>**Remember 2005? I do. Simpler times.
<ul>
    <li>People called each other on their flip phones, or even used the number keypad to do this fancy new thing called "texting". I refrained, it was clearly a fad.</li>
    <li>There was this incredibly absurd reality show where inane people would try to impress a bad used car salesman with silly ideas passed off as "business acumen" in hopes of securing a probably non-existent job. Luckily everyone quickly saw through this and the con man drifted off into the ether where he belonged. <em>Surely everyone quickly saw through this</em>.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile an enterprising entrepeneur plotted a takeover of the world, and was only a few short years away from international fame, fortune, and power. I speak of course of 11-year-old Stratford, Ontario native Justin Bieber. Unlike the grifter of the previous bullet point, this guy was planning on combing all of his hair <em>FORWARD</em>.
</ul>
</p>
<p>*** Or in my case, 237 random coin flip brackets.</p>

<h1>Bugging you for charity</h1>
<p>On a semi-serious note (I'm at least going to start serious, but we all know how well that goes), I want to give a huge thank you to all the Candy Seekers that contributed to my <a href = "https://mssociety.donordrive.com/participant/BenKlaas2022">2022 MS-150 charity bike ride</a>. I'm happy to report I've reached my fundraising goal of &gt;$1500 (which 100% came from JQMCBPers), securing my eligibility for <b>PRIORITY TOILETS</b> for the duration of the ride. I still don't know if I'm going to BEAT LARRY, so if you'd still <a href = "https://mssociety.donordrive.com/participant/BenKlaas2022"> like to donate </a> you may (Operators are standing by! See, I told you I couldn't stay serious).
</p>

<p>The JQMCBP is always and forever 100% free, but I have 100% relied on JQMCBP contributions for this for 10 years now. Hat tip to all y'all.</p>

<h1>Losing Mascots: Let's Talk About Them!</h1>
<h2>Pointless Discussion about Losing Teams and Their Mascots</h2>

<p>We lost another vocational mascot last night:</p>
<div class = "pre">The term "tar heel" dates back to North Carolina's early history, when the state was a leading producer of supplies for the naval industry. Workers who distilled turpentine from the sticky sap of pine trees and burned pine boughs to produce tar and pitch often went barefoot during hot summer months and undoubtedly collected tar on their heels. To call someone a "rosin heel" or "tar heel" was to imply that they worked in a lowly trade.
</div>

<p>
So naturally their mascot is a giant foot.
</p>

<p>(this image cropped at the top to mask hand gesture made after this majestic beast heard I called it a tarheel. "I. AM. A RAM.")</p>

<h1>Upsets...who picked 'em</h1>
<h2>Highlighting those brave souls that chose oddball longshots to win games</h2>

<p>
52 of you had Kansas as your champion, which can't really be called an upset since they were a #1 seed. But North Carolina making it to the championship game was a much rarer prognostication. Only four of you picked UNC to the championship game/accidentally clicked the wrong button.

<h1>Whose champion bit it?</h1>
<h2>Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose, but it never sucks worse than when the team you picked to win it all loses it all. It's even worse when I publish it for all to read!</h2>

<p>
71 of you had your champ in the Final Four but they couldn't pull out the victory. This includes Mark '100 Grand Bar!' Johnson who had UNC as his champ. Amazingly, a UNC championship victory wouldn't have gotten him enough points to win the pool, which would have been the first time the JQMCBP winner would have been someone that hadn't picked the correct champ. Why would Mark not have won? Because the rest of his Final Four were the (absolutely justifiable) picks of Auburn, Gonzaga, and Arizona. His only wild stretch in the Final Four was picking UNC. It was a weird year.

<p>
Only eight of you lost your college in the Final Four. Jeb Byers and Kurt Anderson both seemed to think their 6-week correspondence course with Vinny "The Duke" Vandanken's Pager Repair Service qualified them as Duke alums. I'm going to give it to them.
