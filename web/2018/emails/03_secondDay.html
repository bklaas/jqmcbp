<p>
I begin tonight with an embarrassing admission. After 20 years of running JQMCBP, last year I failed to deliver the Coveted 1st Prize Candy. I know, this is scandalous. Eric "Twix" Young must be wondering if I'm lazy, forgetful, or just unscrupulous. I'm at least two of those, but that's not why the Twix never made it to its rightful owner. 
</p>

<p>
Here's what happened: I mailed the package in the middle of April*, thinking all was well. But the post office returned the package...IN MID JUNE. No joke, <a href = "https://flic.kr/p/XcLskB">I have photo evidence</a>. What can't be seen in the photo, however, is how utterly flattened and destroyed the Twix inside was.
</p>

<p>
So Eric, I tried to contact you last year but something must have gotten crossed up in the intertubes. I see you're back to defend your title. Pop me an email to jqmcbp@gmail.com and I'll send you a Twix. This time with proper postage. And now on to this year's show.
</p>

<p>
* Just to add insult to injury, this was the first and only package I mailed using stamps.com. Not only did the package not get there, possibly due to insufficient postage (which is the whole reason I used stamps.com in the first place, so I'd know how much postage to put on the package without a run to the post office), but then I forgot to cancel the service. Stamps.com is an astounding $15/month whether you mail anything or not. Took me six months before realizing those charges were showing up. In other words, I spent $90 to NOT deliver a single Twix bar.

<h1>Losing Mascots: Let's Talk About Them!</h1>
<h2>Pointless Discussion about Losing Teams and Their Mascots</h2>

<p>
The Lipscomb Bisons. Not a typo: Bisons, not Bison. Apparently, <a href = "https://herosports.com/news/lipscomb-bisons-name-plural-bison-ahah">they are well aware of their misuse, and don't care</a>. I watched some of the Lipscomb-UNC game and was rooting for them before figuring out they come from a lawless university that allows their team to be called "Bisons". I was so down on Lipscomb at this point I changed the channel to an NBA game. It was the Miami Heats against the Utah Jazzes.
</p>

<hr class = 'section' />
<h1>Upsets...who picked 'em</h1>
<h2>Highlighting those brave souls that chose oddball longshots to win games</h2>

<p>
Wichita State, or as we call them around the house here, Wah-Cheetah, were stampeded in a Shocker (see what I did there) by the Marshall Thundering Herd. 74 candy seekers were sharp enough to foretell the Marshall win.
</p>
<p>
I typed the above earlier in the day. I thought the Marshall upset was all I was going to be talking about here. BOY, was I wrong.</p>

<p>For the first time in NCAA history*, a #16 seed has defeated a #1 seed in the first round. And it wasn't just a #1 seed, it was the top-rated #1 seed. And it wasn't just a #16 seed, it was the Maryland Baltimore County Retrievers, playing in just their second NCAA tournament. They only got into the tournament by means of an automatic bid after upsetting the Vermont Catamounts in their conference tournament final.
</p>

<p>
* That should be first team in NCAA <em>Men's</em> tourney history. Harvard won as a #16 seed in the Women's tourney in 1998. Just sayin'.
</p>

<p>Ken Pomeroy, who does a complete statistical ranking of every Division I men's basketball team, had Virginia as the best team in the country. UMBC? They were ranked <b>188th</b>. 188th! The next poorer ranked team in the tourney was 88 slots higher at #100 (and they happened to be the Marshall Thundering Herd, also Friday winners). After the Upset of Upsets Friday night, he dropped Virginia down to #2, and UMBC went up 20 spots to 166th. <a href = "https://kenpom.com/">You can check it out here.</a>
</p>

<p>Yowza. That might be the most I've ever talked about <em>actual basketball</em> in the history of the JQMCBP.</p>

<p>Okay, so typically I'd just list the people who picked a particularly rare upset, but this one was so rare I was interested in their J-factor score, a measure of bracket "riskiness", as well. I've been running J-factors for the past 10 years or more, so I know from experience a J-factor above 10 is typically too absurd a bracket to be taken seriously. For context Chimp brackets, created via virtual coin flips, this year range from about 20-80.</p>

<table class = 'scores'>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>UMBC Lover</th>
			<th>J Factor</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
<tr><td>Todd Krueger</td><td>6.14</td></tr>
<tr><td>Bridget Burns</td><td>10.83</td></tr>
<tr><td>Bloonkadonk</td><td>28.91</td></tr>
<tr><td>nina beatrice 'pony lover' thaler</td><td>39.87</td></tr>
<tr><td>Yaron 'Ankle Breaker' Weiss</td><td>40.42</td></tr>
<tr><td>Lester Roquefort</td><td>44.88</td></tr>

<tr><td>Salty Salmon</td><td>99.99</td></tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p>So, in these 15 people that selected UMBC to beat Virginia, all but one of them had J-factors above 10, and 13 were at <em>or above</em> Chimp brackets. Further, the four J-factors in the high 90s are people selecting an upset in every single game (i.e., worse than random).
</p>
<p>Long story short, there was just one person with a fairly typical human-selected bracket that had UMBC winning tonight. That person was Todd "Theo Organic Fair Trade Black Rice Quinoa Crunch 85% Dark" Krueger. I know TK, and know what he does for a living. He's a librarian in...drumroll...Baltimore County, Maryland.
</p>

<p>This is also fun, take a look at this link: <a href = "https://twitter.com/UMBCAthletics/status/974833660015841283">UMBC Athletics tweet-trolling BBall analyst Seth Davis</a>, who says "Sharpie" when he means you can enter a team in permanent ink in your bracket. The best part of this tweet is the first reponse from the UMBC Bookstore. Solid work, Retrievers!</p>

<p>Again, yowza.</p>
