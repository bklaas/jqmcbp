<h1>JQMCBP Charity Giving</h1>

<p>
For the past several years I've piggy-backed fundraising for my MS-150 bike ride, which raises money for Multiple Sclerosis research. This is a great cause, and I'm proud of the <b>&gt; $5,000 raised</b> <i>almost exclusively from bugging you JQMCBPers for donations</i>. If I haven't done so already (and I haven't! I am exceptionally bad at sending thank yous!), I thank everyone that's donated to this through the years.
</p>

<p>
BUT, I can't ride this year because my in-laws (both doing well in the pool this year!) are having their 50th Wedding Anniversary the same weekend. Congrats Ruth and Glen!
</p>

<p>
The JQMCBP is and always will be 100% free, but this year I'm going to ask your help in funding one of the very good causes below. Wendy and I have donated to every one of the charities listed below, and we hope you can help as well.
