To introduce newcomers to the JQMCBP, <a href="javascript:popUp('/johnnyquest/images/lucky.gif')">Lucky the Chimp</a> is our loyal mascot and favorite repeat offender (see below). He's back again with his random coin-flip-generated picks for the contest. 
<p>
Lucky had a dream run in 2001, picking Duke to win it all (which they did). Although his other picks didn't do so well, he still beat a <a href="javascript:popUp('lucky_losers.html')">huge number of entrants.</a>. 
<p>Typically, Lucky does much (much) worse, so you should consider yourself beaten by a monkey if, well, you get beaten by a monkey.
