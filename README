Here's what's needed: 

copy last year's johnnyquest database to jq_2009
	mysqldump -u root johnnyquest > jq.sql
	CREATE DATABASE jq_2009
	mysql -u root jq_2009 < jq.sql
	now this year's johnnyquest is ready for use (follow instructions below for setup)

html space: copy jqmcbp/web/<last_year> directory space to jqmcbp/web/<this_year>
	cd jqmcbp/web && rm <this_year> && cp -rf <last_year> <this_year> && ln -s <this_year> <next_year>
	<next_year> is a symlink to this year so the dynamic year in jq_globals.pl works up until the next JQMCBP
	change year reference in credits.html
	make sure halloffame list includes last year's winner and loser
	change symlink at website root from <last_year> to <this_year>
data/perl space: 
        cd jqmcbp/perl && rm chimp_data/*.dat && rm lucky/Lucky.dat
        cd jqmcbp && rm data_files/*.dat
	rm jq; ln -s /home/bklaas/jqmcbp_2008 jq

Change all references to JQMCBP X.. to X..+I (web/<year>/templates/overview, web/<year>/emails/invite.html, etc.)

###
USE clear_db.sql to clear database of all values in players, games, player_info, players, filter tables. Do not clear teams table. Let jq_admin.cgi do that.
DO NOT just clear the tables. clear_db.sql will insert values to the games table and NULL out the teams table

command:
mysql -u root -p<pwd> < clear_db.sql

use winners.cgi to define the bracket order (do not just edit www/jqmcbp/brackets.order, as winners.cgi updates the games table with game_* and region info)
BIG FAT WARNING: cgi writes brackets.order to /data/benklaas.com/jqmcbp/. If you are staging in a different area and then copy to the live area, make damn sure that brackets.order is there and in the correct order. Fer Fuck's Sake.

###

change text as necessary throughout
new graphics as needed

test it!

graphomatic: SQL hard-codes a player_id for doing the step-o-matic stuff. update that to something from the current year or it will be broken
