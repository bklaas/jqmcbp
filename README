Here's what's needed: 

(DB copy to jq_2021 already compeleted)

2025: The multi-year encoding problem has been fixed-- in crontab, use the shell script that invokes the encoding fix before the

FOR THE HISTORICAL DOCUMENTS ARCHIVE:
BAD PROBLEM: there are bad chars that get screwed up when entering the pool. Smart quotes, weird apostrophes, etc. Figure out how to fix this.
THIS WAS STILL A BAD PROBLEM IN 2022
2022 Note: Look for the file in perl/badEncodingFixer.py --> with a very small amount of effort this can be used to sanitize badly encoded files. Make sure to test it though!

****
2025: dat2db.pl is now IDEMPOTENT
for the archives:
MAKE dat2db.pl IDEMPOTENT. If it skips entering any files already in the DB, you should be able to continue to run it repeatedly, even after encoding fixes. Either stop using the "done" file or start querying the DB directly.
The dat2db.pl that is in /data/jq_entries is almost there
make it append to the proper done file
figure out a way where a failed entry will cause it to trigger the python script that will fix the encoding
****

2025: Don't bother with below. We're good enough by invoking the python encoding fixer as described above
How to truly fix: The jq_entry.cgi file needs to be rewritten to write utf-8
The database needs possible updating to use utf-8 (?) in its tables
Defo it's jq_entry.cgi that's the source of the awfulness
To try a fix, create a page that just has the first page of entry stuff (name/email) and add candybar. Have it call a jq_entry_devel.cgi that does the same thing as jq_entry.cgi minus the teams. Figure out how to get it to write out unicode data correctly, then test that it can get dropped into the database successfully with dat2db.pl (or equivalent)


------------------
Here's the get-it-up-and-running instructions

copy last year's johnnyquest database to jq_2018
	mysqldump -u root johnnyquest > jq.sql
	CREATE DATABASE jq_2018
	mysql -u root jq_2018 < jq.sql
	now this year's johnnyquest is ready for use (follow instructions below for setup)

html space: copy jqmcbp/web/<last_year> directory space to jqmcbp/web/<this_year>
	cd jqmcbp/web && rm <this_year> && cp -rf <last_year> <this_year> && ln -s <this_year> <next_year>
	<next_year> is a symlink to this year so the dynamic year in jq_globals.pl works up until the next JQMCBP
	change year reference in credits.html
	make sure halloffame list includes last year's winner and loser
	change symlink at website root (/data/benklaas.com) from <last_year> to <this_year>
	cd /data/benklaas.com && rm jqmcbp && ln -s /home/bklaas/jqmcbp_<this_year> jqmcbp
    update ~/.bash_alias for jq and jqw to current year. source ~/.bash_aliases

    cp templates/enter_notyet templates/enter
    edit templates/index and comment out the bits about the tourney being closed for entries
    edit templates/overview to make it a Stay Tuned
    might as well update the main text of overview for the current year

    Go to templates/header and adjust the timer for the countdown
    countdown timer! fix date in templates/header.
    in two places! don't know why!
    around line 48 and line 96
    austDay = new Date(NEW_YEAR, 02, NEW_1_BASED_DAY, 22);

    Change all references to JQMCBP X.. to X..+I (web/<year>/templates/overview, web/<year>/emails/invite.html, etc.)

    # make enter page "not yet"
    jq && cp enter_notyet enter

data/perl space: 
        cd jqmcbp/perl && rm chimp_data/*.dat && rm lucky/*.dat
        cd jqmcbp && rm data_files/*.dat


###
USE ~/jqmcbp/clear_db.sql to clear database of all values in players, games, player_info, players, filter tables. Do not clear teams table. Let jq_admin.cgi do that.
DO NOT just clear the tables. clear_db.sql will insert values to the games table and NULL out the teams table

NOTE TO 2019 BEN FROM 2018 BEN: HOLY CRAP DON'T SCREW UP THE FINAL FOUR REGION ORDER AGAIN. DO NOT USE ESPN. DO NOT. USE. ESPN.
Delay the initial go-live to make sure you have this right. SERIOUSLY.

Also: Watch out to make sure that all second round and onward games in winners.cgi show up as 'foo' and not NULL. If they show up as NULL, RTT will be messed up.

Here's a one-liner sql that will fix it
UPDATE games set winner = 'foo' where round > 1;

Also: graph-o-matic needs a current player_id to work properly. Fix that so the step-o-matic stuff works.
<web_dir>/graphomatic/graph-o-matic.pl and step-o-matic.pl

command:
mysql -u root -p<pwd> < ~/jqmcbp/clear_db.sql

AGAIN FOR EMPHASIS:
use jq_admin.cgi to define the bracket order
BIG FAT WARNING: cgi writes brackets.order to /data/benklaas.com/jqmcbp/brackets.order. If you are staging in a different area and then copy to the live area, make damn sure that brackets.order is there and in the correct order. Fer Fuck's Sake.

BEFORE sending out the invite email:
disable the countdown timer in templates/overview
un-do the "Not Yet" in templates/enter by doing cp templates/enter_now templates/enter

###

NOTE TO 2020 BEN FROM 2019 BEN: do not use apostrophes in team names. 

[PROLLY FIXED 7 Mar 2020-->] also, user www-data doesn't have write permission to /tmp, so the top10* files need to be manually generated (or fix the permissions) with just_the_files.pl, which is in the main web dir

change text as necessary throughout
new graphics as needed

test it!

#######

During the week Sunday-Thurs before things kick off

** Update team names after play-in games finish (teams, player_info)

** Enter the chimps + Lucky.
cd ~/jqmcbp/perl
rm chimp_data/*.dat
rm lucky/*.dat
./1000chimps.pl
./lucky.pl
./dat2db.pl lucky chimp
./dat2db.pl chimp_data chimp

#######

POST-ENTRIES/THURSDAY OF JQMCBP

If you haven't done it yet: Enter all the chimps, including Lucky!

cp templates/enter_closed templates/enter

graphomatic: SQL hard-codes a player_id for doing the step-o-matic stuff. update that to something from the current year or it will be broken
<web_dir>/graphomatic/graph-o-matic.pl and step-o-matic.pl

SSS: go to the root WEB folder and run similarity_index.pl, but only after all your brackets are in, preferably including the late ones.

Past champs:
update player_info set past_champion = TRUE where name = "<champion name>"
there's really no automated way to do this well right now
go to halloffame page
then do these queries
select name, player_id, past_champion from player_info where man_or_chimp = "man" and name like "%Kopaska%";
then grab the player_id and do
update player_info set past_champion = "<YEAR>" where player_id = <player_id>

for play-in games, there is a script to help with this! Look in jqmcbp/perl, it's called fix_play_in_teams.pl
