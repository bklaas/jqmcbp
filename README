Here's what's needed: 

copy last year's johnnyquest database to jq_2009
	mysqldump -u root johnnyquest > jq.sql
	CREATE DATABASE jq_2009
	mysql -u root jq_2009 < jq.sql
	now this year's johnnyquest is ready for use (follow instructions below for setup)

html space: copy johnnyquest/2007/ directory space to johnnyquest/2008/
	rm jqmcbp; ln -s johnnyquest/2008 jqmcbp
	change year reference in credits.html
perl space: copy /home/bklaas/jqmcbp_2007 to /home/bklaas/jqmcbp_2008
	rm jq; ln -s /home/bklaas/jqmcbp_2008 jq

change year in config_variables subroutine ref of cgi-bin/jq_globals.pl 
change year in html space jqmcbp/templates/header

###
USE clear_db.sql to clear database of all values in players, games, player_info, players, filter tables. Do not clear teams table. Let jq_admin.cgi do that.
DO NOT just clear the tables. clear_db.sql will insert values to the games table and NULL out the teams table

NOTE TO 2018 BEN FROM 2017 BEN: watch out to make sure that all second round and onward games in winners.cgi show up as 'foo' and not NULL. If they show up as NULL, RTT will be messed up.

Here's a one-liner sql that will fix it
UPDATE games set winner = 'foo' where round > 1;

command:
mysql -u root -phoopoe < clear_db.sql

use winners.cgi to define the bracket order (do not just edit www/jqmcbp/brackets.order, as winners.cgi updates the games table with game_* and region info)
BIG FAT WARNING: cgi writes brackets.order to /data/benklaas.com/jqmcbp/. If you are staging in a different area and then copy to the live area, make damn sure that brackets.order is there and in the correct order. Fer Fuck's Sake.

change text as necessary throughout
new graphics as needed

test it!

graphomatic: SQL hard-codes a player_id for doing the step-o-matic stuff. update that to something from the current year or it will be broken
